<small>LIFE ON THE OCEAN WAVE</small></h2>


<p>“Oh! It’s yo heave ho! and never let go,
while the stormy winds do blow! blow! blow!”</p>

<p>“Is that you, Jerry Hopkins?” asked a youth,
without looking up from a box he was hammering,
in the yard back of his home.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, my hearty! Shiver my timbers
messmate, but we’re in for a spell of bad weather!”
and Jerry walked up to where Bob Baker was trying
to drive a nail straight into a piece of board.</p>

<p>“Why this sudden nautical turn?” asked Bob,
aiming a hard blow, in hope of correcting a certain
wobbly tendency on the part of the nail. “Is
there&mdash;Wow! Jimminy crickets!” and Bob began
dancing about on one foot, while his thumb
was stuck in his mouth.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Chunky?” asked Jerry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
giving Bob the nickname he sometimes was called
because of his general fleshiness. “Did you hit
your finger?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m doing this for amusement,” replied
Bob, taking his injured thumb from his mouth and
gazing critically at the wounded member. “Um,
it’s going to swell,” he added.</p>

<p>“Put cold water on it,” Jerry advised.
“That’s a good thing. Then wrap it up in
arnica.”</p>

<p>“Come on into the house,” Bob mumbled.
“You can tell me the news there, while I’m doctoring
up.”</p>

<p>“What news?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Why there must be something in the wind
when you come around this way, singing sea songs
and walking like a sailor on a pitching deck.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, of course there’s some news,” Jerry
went on. “I forgot about it in the excitement of
seeing you do that war dance. Well, it’s just as
I was singing. It’s going to be a life on the ocean
wave for me this summer vacation.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?”</p>

<p>“Mother is going to take a cottage on the Atlantic
coast. Maybe I’ll not have swell times!
I’m going in bathing every day, and I can learn all
about a sail boat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>Bob had been so busy looking for the arnica
bottle, and a rag in which to wrap his thumb, that
he paid little attention to what Jerry was saying,
save in a vague sort of way. He caught the last
reference to a boat, however, and asked:</p>

<p>“You’re not going back on our motor boat,
are you, when you say you’re going to take up
with a sail boat? Jerry I’m ashamed of you!”</p>

<p>“Go back on the dear <i>Dartaway</i>? I guess not
much,” Jerry answered. “But we can’t take her
down with us, very well. The cottage is too
small.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” Bob said, in rather
muffled tones, for he held one end of a string in
his mouth and was wrapping the other about the
rag on his thumb. “I wish we were going to the
shore. The folks don’t know yet what they will
do. There, that feels better. When I turn carpenter
again you’ll know it.”</p>

<p>“What were you making?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the cook wanted something to keep the
stove blacking in, and I said I’d make it. Glad
it’s finished though. Maybe she’ll give me something
to eat before dinner’s ready.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say you’re going to eat
again, and breakfast not over more than two
hours?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>“There you go, poking fun at my appetite as
usual,” Bob complained.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s hard to forget it, since you always
seem to have it with you,” Jerry commented, referring
to Bob’s one failing, if it could be so called.</p>

<p>The Baker family’s cook entered the dining
room at this point and Bob mentioned that the
box she had asked for was finished. Then, while
the woman was expressing her thanks, Bob added:</p>

<p>“You haven’t got any bread and butter and jam
you could spare, have you, Mary?”</p>

<p>“Sure there’s lots of it,” was the answer.
“Though it’s not long since I cleared off the breakfast
things. Will I bring two plates?”</p>

<p>“Have some, Jerry?”</p>

<p>Jerry tried to struggle between wanting some
of the good jam he knew would be brought out,
and his desire to maintain his attitude against eating
so soon after the morning meal. Bob watched
him, and laughed.</p>

<p>“Of course you will, Jerry,” he said. “Bring
two plates, and plenty of jam.”</p>

<p>“Seen Ned since last night?” asked Jerry, as
he spread the jam on his bread.</p>

<p>“Nope, but he’s coming over this afternoon,
and we were going out in the boat,” replied Bob,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
hardly pausing between the bites. “Want to
come?”</p>

<p>“Speak of trolley cars and you’ll hear the
gong,” remarked Jerry, as he looked out of the
window and saw Ned Slade across the street.
Ned observed his chums at the same instant and
came over.</p>

<p>“At it again, Chunky?” he asked, as he saw
the refreshments. “How many meals so far to-day?”</p>

<p>“Help yourself,” replied Bob, not bothering to
defend his character.</p>

<p>Ned lost little time in following his chums’ examples,
and Bob, with a laugh, rang the bell to
have the cook bring more bread and butter. The
jam supply still held out.</p>

<p>“Let me make you acquainted with Willie-off-the-Yacht,”
said Bob, nodding toward Jerry.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? Has he bought a pair
of white duck trousers and a cap?”</p>

<p>“Worse and more of it,” Bob answered.
“He’s going to the seashore for the summer, and
learn to run a sail boat.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, it’s about time to think of where
I’m going this summer,” mused Ned. “I heard
the folks say something about the mountains, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
I don’t know as I care for ’em. Wish we could
do as we did last year, and cruise about in the
<i>Dartaway</i>.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t we?” asked Bob, spreading another
piece of bread. “Jerry says he’s going to
the shore, where his mother is hiring a cottage.
Maybe I can persuade my folks to let me go down
along the coast and board; or perhaps they’d go
along. Then if you could come, too, Ned, we
could take the <i>Dartaway</i> with us, and run up and
down the shore, and have no end of good times.
How about it?”</p>

<p>“Sounds good to me,” Ned replied. “I
guess we could manage it. How could we get the
boat down?”</p>

<p>“Have it boxed and shipped, of course,” Bob
replied. “It traveled a good way over land before
it got to us, and I guess it wouldn’t cost
much.”</p>

<p>“Say, that would be sport!” exclaimed Jerry.
“There is just the place for a motor boat where
mother is going.”</p>

<p>“Where’s that?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Harmon Beach. There’s a sort of cove there,
where the boats are sheltered from storms. But
you can go through the inlet right out to sea, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
then up and down the coast. The <i>Dartaway</i> is
big enough to stand a bit of bad weather, if it
don’t come too strong.”</p>

<p>“Then let’s do it,” exclaimed Bob. “I’ll
speak to my folks right away, and will you fellows
do the same? Then we can talk it over again.”</p>

<p>“I’m pretty sure dad is going to the Berkshires,”
Ned answered, “but I don’t have to go
with the rest of the family. I’ll find out as soon
as I can. Are there any good boarding houses
at Harmon Beach, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know much about that part of it, but
I’ll ask mother to take a larger cottage than she
counted on and you two boys can come with me.”</p>

<p>“Fine!” cried the others. “That will be the
best ever,” went on Bob. “Here’s your hat,
Jerry, go home and ask her right away.”</p>

<p>“Well, I like your nerve, Bob Baker!” exclaimed
Jerry. “Nice way to treat company!
Here’s your hat, what’s your hurry? I’ll come
again!” and he pretended to get angry.</p>

<p>“Oh, you know I didn’t mean it that way!”
cried Bob, fearing he had offended his friend.
“It’s only that we’re anxious, you know. I
want&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hark! What’s that?” cried Ned, running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
to the window, just as the only ambulance the
town of Cresville possessed, went by with the gong
clanging.</p>

<p>“Something has happened!” exclaimed Jerry.
“See all the people running.”</p>

<p>The three boys hurried to the front door. The
street was filled with a hurrying and excited
throng, every one going in the same direction.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Bob, of a boy
running past the house.</p>

<p>“Railroad collision! Lots killed! Down
near the cut crossing!” the lad exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Come on!” Jerry shouted. “Let’s go!”</p>

<small>THE RAILROAD WRECK</small></h2>


<p>The boys grabbed up their hats, raced down the
steps, and along the street in the direction of the
railroad. While they are on their way, the reader
may care to ascertain a little more about the three
chums, and something of their doings, which have
been set forth in previous volumes of this series.</p>

<p>Jerry Hopkins was the son of a well-to-do
widow, Bob Baker the offspring of a rich banker,
while Ned Slade’s father owned a large department
store.</p>

<p>The first volume of the series, entitled “The
Motor Boys,” told how the lads took part in bicycle
races, and how one of them won a fine motor
cycle. They incurred the enmity of Noddy
Nixon, a town bully, and his crony, Bill Berry.
The chums had many experiences on their motor
cycles, and in a race they won a fine touring automobile.
Their adventures, and exciting ones they
were, which followed the acquisition of the car,
were told of in the second volume, “The Motor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Boys Overland.” They went west to search for
an old mine, of which a prospector they had befriended
had told them. They found the claim,
with the aid of Jim Nestor, though they had a
close race with Noddy Nixon and Bill Berry to get
formal possession.</p>

<p>On their western trip the boys had become acquainted
with an old man, Professor Uriah Snodgrass,
a naturalist, and he told them of an ancient
buried city in Old Mexico. The boys resolved to
search for it, and how they succeeded was set forth
in the third volume, “The Motor Boys in Mexico.”
They had several fights with the Mexicans
and Bob was kidnapped, but escaped. The ancient
city was found, very unexpectedly, as the auto
sunk down through a concealed road and
coursed along an underground passage. There
many strange things occurred, including the discovery
of the disappearing reservoir, and a valuable
box of jewels.</p>

<p>The boys decided to visit their mine, on their
way back to the United States, and it was a good
thing they did, as it had fallen into the possession
of the plotters, as related in “The Motor Boys
Across the Plains.” An old hermit, who lived
near a lake, proved to be the father of a boy the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
three chums rescued from a desperate gang and,
later, the hermit was of much assistance in retaining
possession of the mine for the motor boys, since
he was one of the original prospectors.</p>

<p>The boys returned home after that. They had
saved quite a sum of money from their share of the
mine profits, and invested it in a fine motor boat,
the <i>Dartaway</i>. As set forth in the fifth volume
of the series, entitled “The Motor Boys Afloat,”
the three chums transferred their energies to river
and lake, and took part in races, foiled the plot
Noddy Nixon laid, and solved the mystery of a
strange schooner and the robbery of Mr. Slade’s
store. They had an exciting chase after the
thieves, rendering the police much assistance.</p>

<p>All their adventures took place during their
school vacations. Now another one was at hand,
and, naturally enough, the boys wanted to have as
much fun as had fallen to their lot in the past.
But, while they were racing to the railroad wreck,
their minds were more on that than on what the
summer might hold for them.</p>

<p>“I wonder if many are killed?” Bob said.</p>

<p>“Looks as though some were, as there goes the
morgue wagon. There must be a number injured,
too,” Jerry replied. “There go Dr. Bounce, Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Jones and Dr. Hardy,” and he pointed to the
carriages of the three physicians. The medical
men were urging their horses to a gallop.</p>

<p>Following the crowd the boys soon found themselves
near the railroad, which swept up to Cresville
in a long curve, after passing through a deep
cut. It was in this cut where the wreck had occurred.
The boys could see, from the top of a
little hill, a great crowd gathered about the entrance
to the gorge.</p>

<p>“Come on!” cried Ned. “Maybe we can
help!”</p>

<p>It was a terrible sight that met the boys’ eyes
as they entered the narrow cut. As they learned
later a defective rail had caused the smash-up.
The engine had jumped the track, and crashed into
the rocky sides of the defile. The cars had piled
on top of the locomotive, and there was a mass of
wreckage.</p>

<p>Wheels and trucks were scattered about. The
top of one car had been sliced off, and was resting
on the coach in front of it. Another car was almost
inside of another, and the smoker had
mounted the engine tender, the wheels being buried
in the coal and water tank.</p>

<p>Fortunately it was summer, and there was no
fire in the cars, so the wreckage did not ignite.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
The coals from the engine boiler had started a
small blaze, but this had been put out.</p>

<p>The train was a through one, not scheduled to
stop at Cresville, and there had been comparatively
few passengers aboard.</p>

<p>The rescuers were already at work. Several
bodies had been carried from the wreck, and placed
on beds made from the car seats. One or two
silent forms, under shawls and blankets, told, better
than words, that death had come swiftly to the
unfortunates.</p>

<p>There were several badly injured, and it was to
them that the physicians gave prompt attention.
The majority of the hurt were women and children,
though there were some men. Only the
fact that travel was light, just preceding the annual
vacation rush, prevented a terrible loss of life.</p>

<p>At first the boys did not know what to do to
assist, though they felt they should help, as far
as possible. They stood in the front of the
crowd, which the railroad men were endeavoring
to keep back, and looked on, their hearts palpitating
with the terrible sights they witnessed. As
they stood there Dr. Bounce, who had just finished
bandaging up a man’s leg, came past. He
knew the three boys, and, as he saw them, he
called:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here, Jerry, you and your friends come in
here and help me, will you? I’ve got my hands
full. One of you carry my medicine case, and the
others rummage around and get all the cloth you
can for bandages. Tear up the sheets in the
sleeper. That is the last car and didn’t smash up
as badly as the others.”</p>

<p>Anxious to take part in the work, and glad to
be called on by Dr. Bounce, the boys slipped
through the cordon of railroad men, who, at a
nod from the physician, let them pass, and followed
the doctor.</p>

<p>Jerry took the medical man’s valise, containing
its grim instruments and also the healing remedies,
and the merciful chloroform to relieve pain.
Ned and Bob found their way to the wrecked
sleeper. No one was in it, and they got an axe
and broke open some of the berths, which were
jammed shut. They took out pillows, sheets and
blankets, which willing hands soon distributed
among the wounded.</p>

<p>The two boys tore the sheets into long strips
that Dr. Bounce and the other physicians used to
bind up the cuts and bruises of the wounded. As
fast as the passengers were taken from the wreck
they were put on improvised stretchers and carried
out of the dark and gloomy gorge to the level<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
land beyond, where the doctors could work over
them.</p>

<p>Jerry was kept busy attending on Dr. Bounce,
handing him this instrument or that, and pouring
out the medicines under the physician’s directions.</p>

<p>The scene was one of confusion and terror.
Cries and groans of the wounded mingled with the
weeping of those who had lost loved ones in the
crash. Then came the noise of axes, hammers
and saws on wood, the implements being used to
free some imprisoned victims, held down by heavy
timbers.</p>

<p>It seemed that all were now rescued who could
escape by their own efforts or be carried out by
the workers. There only remained the possible
dead under the wreck and those who might be held
fast in it. The boys had a brief respite from their
strenuous labors. They were standing together,
hardly able to realize what they had seen and taken
part in.</p>

<p>Suddenly a small boy rushed up to where the
chums were standing. He seemed greatly excited.</p>

<p>“Come here, quick!” he called.</p>

<p>“What is it, Andy Rush?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Man&mdash;pinned under a big beam&mdash;groaning
awful&mdash;makes me have the shivers&mdash;I tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
to get him&mdash;couldn’t&mdash;head hurt I guess&mdash;come
on&mdash;help me&mdash;we’ll save his life,” and
finishing his usual disjointed and rapid-fire remarks
Andy hurried off, followed by the three
chums on the run.</p>

<p>He led them to the rear end of a telescoped car.
There, pinned under a pile of seats, was a gray
haired man, his white locks stained with blood.
He was groaning feebly.</p>

<p>With a quick eye Jerry saw one particular plank
that was holding the others like a wedge. He
caught up a hammer and, with a few heavy blows,
knocked the splintered timber out of place. Then
he and the other boys were able to lift the man out.
As they carried him to where the other wounded
were lying on improvised cots, the wounded passenger
murmured:</p>

<p>“Jess!&mdash;Jess!&mdash;Where are you? Jess!
Jess!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>A QUEER OLD MAN</small></h2>


<p>“Here, Dr. Bounce!” called Jerry, as he and
his chums laid the aged man down on a pile of
car cushions, “here’s a man who needs your attention,”
and the physician, who was hurrying past,
stopped.</p>

<p>“Where did you find him?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Got him out of the wreck,” replied Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, you boys are certainly doing good
work,” Dr. Bounce remarked. He bent over the
old man and felt of his head. “Skull fractured,”
he murmured. “Not much chance.”</p>

<p>By this time the ambulance which had made
several trips came back, and in it the man the boys
had saved was taken to the hospital, being one of
the last to go.</p>

<p>Never before had there been such excitement
in Cresville. The whole town was aroused, and
every one offered some aid to the wounded. There
were a number taken to private houses, and cared
for there, as the hospital was a small one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon the wrecking crew came, the men working
rapidly to get the tracks cleared. Because
the smash had occurred in the cut there was no
chance to build a temporary track around it, as is
sometimes done.</p>

<p>Then came a swarm of reporters from Boston,
which was not far from Cresville. They kept the
telegraph wires fairly sizzling with dispatches,
telling of the terrible wreck.</p>

<p>A big crowd remained at the scene long after
the damaged cars and engine had been hauled
away, and the line put in shape for use, which was
late in the afternoon. The three boys, who, to
tell the truth, were nervous and upset from the
unaccustomed sights, left shortly after the old man
had been taken away.</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked Bob, as they strolled back
toward his house, “it would be hard to beat that
for excitement.”</p>

<p>“What were we doing just before it happened?”
asked Ned. “It seems like a week ago
when we ran out to join the crowd.”</p>

<p>“We were talking about going to the shore with
our motor boat,” Jerry put in.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. Well, let’s see if we can’t work
that scheme. Suppose you two come over to my
house this afternoon,” spoke Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>His chums said they would, and then the three
separated, their minds filled with a strange combination;
the pleasures that might be in store for
them mingling with the sad memories of the
wreck.</p>

<p>Jerry spoke of the boys’ plan to his mother at
dinner. She took a little time to think it over,
and then announced she would try to get a large
cottage if possible.</p>

<p>“Ned and Bob can come and stay with you,”
she said, “that is if their folks will let them. I
want to see you all have a good time, and I believe
the motor boat will be just the thing at the
shore. Only you must be very careful. When I
think of some of the things you and your friends
went through with, Jerry, it frightens me.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess we can look after ourselves,
mother. We’ve pulled out of some pretty tight
places.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hopkins wrote a letter to a real estate
agent at Harmon Beach, and Jerry was so anxious
to have the plan succeed that he did not forget to
mail the epistle which his mother gave him to post
as he was going out. It was the first time such a
thing had occurred in quite a while, as Jerry had a
bad habit of forgetting to drop letters in the post-office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Happy in the anticipation that he and his chums
would be able to spend the summer together, Jerry
whistled a gleeful mixture of all the sea songs he
had ever heard, as he hurried over to Ned’s house.
He found both his chums there.</p>

<p>“How about it?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“My part is all right,” announced Jerry,
“though of course it depended on whether a
large-enough cottage can be secured.” But he
did not think that detail worth bothering about.
If worst came to worst he knew he and his chums
would sleep on the floor in one room.</p>

<p>“I can go,” Bob announced, and Ned chimed
in to say his parents had no objections if he was to
stay at Mrs. Hopkins’s house.</p>

<p>“Then it’s all arranged,” Jerry said, in boyish
confidence. “Now we’ll have to overhaul the
<i>Dartaway</i>, and get her in shape. A new awning
would do no harm, and I think we’ll need a little
heavier anchor.”</p>

<p>With boundless enthusiasm the boys began to
discuss their plans. They jumped from one thing
to another, from the possibility of cruising half
way to Florida to doing deep-sea-fishing in their
motor boat.</p>

<p>“We’ll have the time of our lives,” said Bob.
“We’ll&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>At that instant the door of the sitting room
where the chums were opened and Dr. Bounce
entered.</p>

<p>“You boys were talking so loudly you didn’t
hear me knock I guess,” he said.</p>

<p>“Is any one sick?” inquired Ned, thinking the
medical man had called to attend some one.</p>

<p>“Not here,” replied Dr. Bounce, “but there
are enough cases in town to keep ten doctors busy.
No, I called about that old man you helped get
out of the wreck.”</p>

<p>“Is he dead?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid he can’t last long. He regained
consciousness a little while ago, and wanted the
three boys who took him from under the seats to
be sent for. Do any of you know him?”</p>

<p>“Why, no. Did he mention any of us by
name?” inquired Bob.</p>

<p>“No, but he insisted he wanted to see the three
boys, and I happened to remember it was you who
saved him. He seems to have something on his
mind. Perhaps it will make him rest more easily
if you go to the hospital and see him. It may be
only an odd fancy, but sometimes we have to
humor our patients. Will you go?”</p>

<p>The boys said they would, and while they were
getting their hats Dr. Bounce told them how he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
had first gone to Jerry’s house and then to Bob’s,
before he arrived at Ned’s.</p>

<p>The hospital was so crowded with patients from
the wreck that even the office of the superintendent
and some of the doctors’ rooms were used. On
cots in them were men and women; some badly injured.</p>

<p>The aged man had a small room to himself, as
his case was regarded as critical. Dr. Bounce,
preceding the three boys, entered. He paused
for a few seconds regarding the patient, who
seemed to be sleeping. Then the physician
turned, and silently beckoned the boys to approach.
As they came near the old man opened his eyes
and regarded them curiously for a moment.</p>

<p>“Are these the boys you wanted to see?” inquired
Dr. Bounce.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” was the eager reply. The man
tried to raise himself in bed, but was so weak he
fell back on the pillow.</p>

<p>“Calm yourself,” said Dr. Bounce soothingly.
“You must not get excited. What did you want
of the boys?”</p>

<p>“I want Jess,” murmured the man, looking first
at one of the boys, and then at the other. “I was
on my way to get her, after long years of separation,
when there came a terrible blow on my head.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>“But what have the boys to do with it, and
who is Jess?” asked Dr. Bounce.</p>

<p>“They will find her for me. They know where
she is. Where the great light is. They can find
her. They are smart boys. I can see that.”
Then his mind wandered. “I must have my Jess.
Maybe she was killed in the wreck! Oh, boys,
please find her for me! Perhaps she is pinned
down under the seat where you rescued me!”</p>

<p>The chums looked at each other curiously.
Dr. Bounce placed his hand on the old man’s
pulse.</p>

<p>“Tell us who you are,” the physician said.
“Who is Jess, and how can the boys find her?”</p>

<p>“Jess&mdash;Jess&mdash;where the great light shines
at night,&mdash;Bring her to me&mdash;I am&mdash;I am&mdash;Jess&mdash;the
boys will find you&mdash;they will save
you! Oh, the awful crash!”</p>

<p>The next instant the old man, who, in his excitement,
had risen from the pillow fell backward,
and his eyes closed. A terror seemed to grip the
boys’ hearts. They thought they had seen death
come. Dr. Bounce rang a bell to summon a
nurse.</p>

<p>“He has become unconscious again after his
raving,” the doctor said. “I’m afraid my experiment
was a failure. Do you know who Jess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
is, or what he is referring to about the ‘great
light,’ boys?”</p>

<p>“Not in the least,” replied Jerry, and his
chums said the same.</p>

<p>“Was any one of that name killed or hurt in
the wreck?” Dr. Bounce went on.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Bob. “I have looked over the
list as published in one of the extras, and all the
passengers are accounted for. No one was named
Jess.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose he could have meant a dog
called Jess?” came from Ned. “He seemed
to think some one might be pinned down under the
seats where he was.”</p>

<p>“But he spoke of going to claim her after a
long separation,” Dr. Bounce went on, while the
nurse was administering medicine to the unconscious
patient. “That would apply only to a
person. No, I believe Jess is a girl or a woman.
There seems to be some mystery connected with
her.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we will happen to solve it some day,”
remarked Jerry. “I wonder what he meant by
the ‘great light?’”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>OFF TO THE COAST</small></h2>


<p>“Perhaps a search light on some vessel,” put
in Ned. “He looks like a seafaring man.”</p>

<p>“I think you boys had better go, now,” said Dr.
Bounce. “We will have to operate on the patient,
but I am afraid it will be a long time before
he recovers his senses. If he does and wants to
see you, I will let you know. I would like to get
at the bottom of this. Strange, he should think
you boys could rescue Jess. Stranger still, who
is Jess?”</p>

<p>But, for a while at least, there was no prospect
of solving the strange meaning of the old man.
His condition grew worse, and there was little hope
for him.</p>

<p>That night the boys heard that though the operation
was performed it was not entirely successful.
A piece of bone was pressing on the man’s
brain, and it was found impossible to remove it until
his condition improved. Consequently he remained
in a stupor, and could not talk. He murmured,
in his delirium, Dr. Bounce said, something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
about Jess and the light, and there he
stopped.</p>

<p>Three days after the wreck Mrs. Hopkins got
a letter from the real estate agent informing her
he had been able to secure a large cottage, close to
the beach. It was on a small cove, and there was
a boathouse near by.</p>

<p>“Fine!” cried Jerry when he heard of it.
“Now to get the <i>Dartaway</i> ready. Whoop!
But life is worth living, I tell you!” and he began
to dance a jig with such vigor that the dishes on
the sideboard rattled.</p>

<p>“Jerry, you’ll smash some of my fine cut
glass!” exclaimed Mrs. Hopkins in alarm, yet she
could not help being glad that she was able to provide
a summer’s outing for her son and his chums.</p>

<p>“I’m going over to tell Ned and Bob,” Jerry
said, rushing from the house. As he hurried down
the steps he collided with a youth who was just
then passing the house.</p>

<p>“Oh, I beg your pardon,” said Jerry, his breath
almost taken away by the sudden impact.</p>

<p>“You did that on purpose! You saw me coming
and tried to knock me down!” exclaimed the
youth, and Jerry saw it was Noddy Nixon, the old
enemy of himself and his chums.</p>

<p>“Why, Noddy,” remarked Jerry, much surprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
at the sudden encounter and the identity of
the youth. “Where did you come from?
Haven’t seen you since&mdash;”</p>

<p>Jerry was about to say he had not met Noddy
since the time of the chase after the thieves in the
motor boat, and the escape of Bill Berry and
Noddy, as told in the fifth volume of this series,
“The Motor Boys Afloat.” But he thought better
of it, and stopped in time.</p>

<p>“Don’t you make any references to me,” said
Noddy, as he rubbed his shin, which Jerry had accidentally
kicked. “If you spread any scandals
about me I’ll have you sued. I’ve a good notion
to have you arrested for assault and battery!”</p>

<p>“Look here, Noddy Nixon!” exclaimed Jerry.
“I apologized for colliding with you. That’s
all I’m going to do. You can put that in your
pipe and smoke it,” and without a look at the bully
Jerry turned and walked off.</p>

<p>“You’ll pay for this, Jerry Hopkins,” called
Noddy. “I’ll get even with you.”</p>

<p>Jerry had heard Noddy threaten like that before,
and, generally the bully had found means to
make it very uncomfortable for the chums. But
Jerry did not fear him, and he felt he could hold
up his own end fairly well. As for his friends, he
did not worry on their account.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wonder where he’s been all this while,” Jerry
mused, as he continued on toward Bob’s house.
“He has a queer way of disappearing and coming
back at the most unexpected times.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, going into your second
childhood, Jerry?” some one asked, and Jerry
looked up suddenly, to see Bob standing in front of
him.</p>

<p>“Hello, Chunky,” he called. “What’s that?”</p>

<p>“You were talking to yourself like an old man,”
explained Bob. “I was getting worried about
you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I just had a little run-in with Noddy
Nixon,” Jerry explained, smiling as he recalled
how well his words described what had taken place.</p>

<p>“So he’s back, eh? Well, look out for
trouble.”</p>

<p>“Guess it can’t amount to much. We will be
away from here in another week.”</p>

<p>“Did your mother get the cottage?”</p>

<p>“Sure. Come on, let’s tell Ned.”</p>

<p>The three boys were soon at Bob’s house discussing
their plans in detail. Their interest in
them made them forget Noddy and the trouble he
threatened. But, had they seen a letter which the
bully posted a short time after, addressed to Bill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Berry, and accepting a certain invitation, they
might have felt a little worried.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to hustle to get things in shape,”
said Bob, when the date of departure had been
settled. “The first thing is to arrange to have
the boat shipped. Let’s go over to the freight
office and see the agent. I&mdash;”</p>

<p>Bob was interrupted at that instant by the entrance
of the cook, with a tray of sandwiches and
a pitcher of milk.</p>

<p>“Oh,” she said. “I didn’t know there were
three of you here,” and she looked at Bob, who
grinned sheepishly.</p>

<p>“Chunky!” exclaimed Ned. “Did you order
all this for yourself,” and he gazed reproachfully
at his chum.</p>

<p>“Well you see I told her to get it ready a while
ago,” explained Bob. “I didn’t know then you
two were coming over. I went out to post a letter
and I met Jerry and we saw you. Then I forgot
all about this until&mdash;but she’ll get some more,
won’t you Mary?”</p>

<p>“Sure, Master Bob, if you want it.”</p>

<p>“I move that Bob be compelled to sit there and
see Jerry and I eat all this up,” spoke Ned, beginning
with a sandwich in each hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Poor Chunky looked so woe-begone at this inroad
on his rations that his two chums laughed.</p>

<p>“Oh, pitch in!” said Jerry. “I know how you
feel, Bob. It must be all of two hours since you
had anything to eat.”</p>

<p>Over their lunch the boys laid out their work,
dividing it among themselves so as to get it all
done in time. Bob was to attend to the shipping
arrangements, Ned to refitting the boat, and
Jerry said he would sort over the portable camping
outfit the boys always took with them.</p>

<p>The <i>Dartaway</i> was a fine, stanch craft, of four
cylinders, as speedy as one could wish. It had
many new appliances, such as three speeds forward
and one reverse, and was well fitted up. There
was a small galley where a meal could be cooked,
and a folding table to serve it on. The stove
burned gasolene.</p>

<p>There was a portable awning which had side
curtains, so the whole boat could be enclosed in
stormy weather. There were also collapsible
bunks, so, if necessary they could remain on board
several days without going ashore. There were
food lockers and a good sized storage tank for
gasolene.</p>

<p>In anticipation that they might make rather
lengthy trips the boys got a larger searchlight for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
their craft than the one they had first used, and
also a larger saluting cannon. A more reliable
compass was added to the equipment, and the size
of the whistle was increased, to give better precaution
in case of fogs.</p>

<p>An anchor, as large as could be carried, was installed,
and, with several other minor, but necessary
improvements, the boys felt they had a motor
craft second to none for its size.</p>

<p>It was no easy task to box the boat and ship it
to Harmon Beach. But the boys worked like
Trojans, and accomplished much that less enthusiastic
persons would have shrunk from undertaking.
Finally they saw the <i>Dartaway</i> loaded on a
flat car at the freight office.</p>

<p>“Now to get ourselves off,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>But this was an easier task. Three days later
found Mrs. Hopkins at her summer cottage. It
would not be quite correct to say that the boys
were there also, for they had no sooner alighted
from the train than they hurried to the freight
office to see if their boat had arrived.</p>

<p>“There she is!” cried Jerry, pointing to a
bulky object on the station platform. “Now for
a spin on salt water.”</p>

<p>But there was a wait of several hours before the
boys’ desires were realized. Only their boundless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
enthusiasm and their tireless energy made it
possible, but, by evening the boat had been hauled
to the small dock near Mrs. Hopkins’s cottage, and
launched.</p>

<p>The boys did not stop to fully equip her. They
saw that the engine was working well, and, just at
dusk, three happy, if very tired lads, sat in the
<i>Dartaway</i> and sent the craft in a wide circle
around the little cove on which the colony of Harmon
Beach was situated.</p>

<p>“Put out toward Old Briny!” called Ned to
Jerry, who was steering, and Jerry, nothing loath,
did so.</p>

<p>As the speedy craft surged ahead, throwing up
a salty spray, the boys heard a hail behind them.</p>

<p>“Here! Come back!” some one called.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>CAUGHT IN A SQUALL</small></h2>


<p>“Who is it?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Seems to be some one in another motor boat,”
Bob replied. “He’s waving at us.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he wants a race,” suggested Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, he can have it if he catches up to us,”
Jerry responded. “I’m not going to race otherwise.
The <i>Dartaway</i> is not in her best trim, and
she may get beaten. Then we’ll get the name of
having a slow boat. We’ll have a regular race
later, when we are in better shape,” and he put
on a little more speed.</p>

<p>Still from behind came the cry over the water:</p>

<p>“Come back! Come back!”</p>

<p>“Oh, cut it out!” exclaimed Bob as he felt the
salt wind and spray in his face. “We can’t
bother with you. We’re out for a good time.
Catch us if you can!”</p>

<p>“Isn’t this glorious!” exclaimed Ned. “Say,
but I’m glad we came!”</p>

<p>The <i>Dartaway</i> had increased her speed considerably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
and was fairly flying through the water.
The boys could no longer hear the hailing of the
lone man in the boat behind, though they could
still see him coming after them.</p>

<p>“Guess if he wants a race he’ll feel sort of discouraged,”
Jerry remarked, as he put the wheel
over a bit to meet an oncoming wave.</p>

<p>“Funny sort of a chap,” said Bob. “Thinks
we ought to stop for him, I s’pose.”</p>

<p>The craft was now approaching one of the two
points of land which enclosed the cove of Harmon
Beach. The wind, which had been blowing quite
strongly, increased in volume and the water became
a little rougher. Still there had been just
as much disturbance on Lake Cantoga, where the
boys had cut their eye teeth in running a boat, and
they were not alarmed.</p>

<p>It was getting dusk now, and, off to the east
there was a curious haze hanging over the water.
Jerry, who was peering sharply ahead, remarked:</p>

<p>“Looks like breakers beyond,” for he had
caught sight of some white caps.</p>

<p>“We don’t mind them,” said Ned. “I guess
our boat is strong enough to navigate through
’em.”</p>

<p>“Our friend seems to have given up trying to
catch us,” Bob said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>“He never had a chance,” came from Ned.</p>

<p>“Hold hard!” Jerry suddenly cried. “Look
out!”</p>

<p>An instant later a shower of spray flew over the
boat, wetting the boys.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! It’s salt water!” yelled Ned.</p>

<p>“Old Briny!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“Of course it is,” spoke Jerry, as he wiped the
water from his eyes. “We’re right out on the
ocean now.”</p>

<p>“Really?” asked Ned, hardly able to believe it.</p>

<p>“Sure,” Jerry added. “We’ve gotten beyond
the point of the cove and it’s open water ahead of
us now. Europe lies just beyond. Shall we put
for it?”</p>

<p>Another dash of spray caused the boys to duck.</p>

<p>“Not to-night,” came from Bob. “There’s
nothing on board to eat.”</p>

<p>“You’d think of that if you were headed
straight for Davy Jones’s locker,” exclaimed Ned.
“Why can’t you forget it, Chunky?”</p>

<p>“This sea air gives me such an appetite,” replied
the stout youth.</p>

<p>“Well, we haven’t anything on board to&mdash;”
began Ned, when his remarks were suddenly interrupted
by a roll of the boat that nearly threw
him over the side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“Look out!” cried Jerry. “Here comes a
big wave!”</p>

<p>Almost as he spoke there was a rush of greenish-white
water and something more substantial
than spray came aboard the <i>Dartaway</i>.</p>

<p>At the same instant there was an increase in the
force of the wind, which fairly howled overhead,
and sent the spume from the crests of the waves
with stinging force into the faces of the boys.</p>

<p>“What is it?” panted Bob, as he tried to get
his breath, after swallowing a mouthful of salt
water.</p>

<p>“We seem to have gotten out to sea in a hurry,”
replied Jerry.</p>

<p>“It’s beginning to rain!” yelled Ned.</p>

<p>Then everything seemed blotted out by a gray
blanket of mist, caused by the drenching downpour.
The boys were wet through in an instant,
though they tried to cover themselves with some
pieces of canvas.</p>

<p>In their hurry to get the boat into the water
they had not set the awning. In fact the craft
was not at all equipped for a trip, beyond the fact
that she could go, since there was plenty of gasolene
in the tank.</p>

<p>The <i>Dartaway</i> was rocking and bobbing about
on the rough water, for, once beyond the protection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
of the cove, the full force of the waves and
wind was felt.</p>

<p>“Turn around, Jerry!” yelled Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes! Put back!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“Too risky!” sung out Jerry. “I’ve got to
keep her head into the wind,” and he swung the
wheel around to meet a big wave.</p>

<p>The crested roller of green water struck the boat
half broadside on. Considerable came aboard,
but the <i>Dartaway</i>, after staggering a bit under the
weight, rose to it like a duck, and went on. Jerry
started the automatic pump and the water was soon
forced out.</p>

<p>“Say, we are in for it!” Bob yelled.</p>

<p>“It’s nothing but a squall!” Jerry called back.
He did not have time to turn around, because he
had to devote all his attention to the wheel.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” asked Ned,
shouting the words out. Indeed nothing less than
a yell could have been heard above the roar of the
wind, the swish of the rain and the splash of the
water as it struck the side of the little craft.</p>

<p>“Going to keep on,” replied Jerry grimly.
“It’s all I can do. If I turn back I’ll be swamped.
Maybe I can run into a quiet cove, somewhere
along the beach.”</p>

<p>The squall was now raging in all its sudden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
but short-lasting fury. Though the boys realized
it would not keep up its capers very long, they
knew that their position was anything but a safe
one. It was nearly dusk, with the dying light of
sunset hidden by the mist and clouds.</p>

<p>Still, as Jerry had said, there was nothing to do
but keep on. By doing so the bow of the boat
could be held so as to cleave the waves. To turn
meant to get them broadside on and this would
soon swamp the craft.</p>

<p>“Isn’t there some place we can put in to?”
yelled Ned.</p>

<p>“Don’t know of any,” Jerry called back.</p>

<p>Down came the rain, harder than before, and
the wind seemed to howl in glee at the plight of
the boys. The craft was tossing to and fro on
the waves, which, while not of any extraordinary
size, were almost too big for the <i>Dartaway</i>. They
would have amounted to nothing for a larger boat,
with more freeboard than had the motor craft.</p>

<p>Ned and Bob crouched in the bottom of the
boat, to render it more steady, while Jerry clung to
the wheel, which now and then was almost jerked
from his hand by the force of the water on the
rudder.</p>

<p>Every now and then the salt spray would dash
over the craft, adding its saline dampness to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
caused by the rain. It was now quite dark, with
the rain making it all the more difficult to see.
Jerry tried to pierce the gloom, for he had no more
idea where he was going than a blind man. He
knew he had started to pass out of the harbor of
Harmon Beach, between the two points of land,
and that he was steering east then. But, whether
he had kept the boat headed in that direction was
a question he could not answer.</p>

<p>In spite of it all the <i>Dartaway</i> was behaving admirably.
She stood up to the attack of the waves
and wind like a veteran. It was her baptism of
the Atlantic, and she seemed to rejoice in it.</p>

<p>“Hark! I hear something!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>The boys listened as well as they could above
the throbbing of the engine. Over the storm-swept
waters there sounded three long whistles.</p>

<p>“It’s a boat!” cried Bob. “Look out, or
she’ll run us down!”</p>

<p>“Can’t tell where she is,” Jerry answered, his
hand on the lever to stop the engine in an instant.</p>

<p>“It’s behind us,” Ned shouted, standing up and
trying to see to the rear.</p>

<p>Once more the whistle sounded. This time it
was clearer, and in spite of the roar of the wind
and the swish of the waves the boys could hear the
throb of a boat engine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>“Some one is coming after us!” exclaimed Bob.</p>

<p>Just then, through the mist of the storm there
shone a great light, full on the <i>Dartaway</i>. It
flashed a glaring beacon on the boat, and then
suddenly it turned red, flashed twice, and disappeared.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>THE RACE</small></h2>


<p>“What was that?” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“Lightning!” came from Bob.</p>

<p>“Lightning doesn’t act that way!” Jerry replied.
He put the wheel over to meet an on-coming
roller. As he did so the queer light flashed
out again. First it was white, and then it changed
to red, showing twice and going out.</p>

<p>“It’s a lighthouse!” cried Jerry. “I forgot
there is one near here. It’s near a dangerous
ledge of rocks, which are off shore.”</p>

<p>“Then we’d better stop!” cried Ned. “We
may sink the boat.”</p>

<p>“Can’t turn around now. Too risky.”</p>

<p>Suddenly three sharp whistles sounded so close
to the <i>Dartaway</i> that the boys jumped in fright.
They thought they were about to be run down.
Then came a hail:</p>

<p>“Say, what you chaps trying to do? Commit
suicide?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who are you?” called Jerry, slowing down
the engine.</p>

<p>“This is the <i>Three Bells</i>. Who are you?”</p>

<p>“<i>Dartaway.</i>”</p>

<p>“Where from?”</p>

<p>“Harmon Beach.”</p>

<p>Out of the mist there loomed up alongside of
the boys’ boat another motor craft. It was nearly
twice the size of theirs, and the throb of the engine,
though it was running slow and on low gear,
told better than words of the power of it.</p>

<p>The rain ceased, almost as suddenly as it had
started and the fury of the squall, having blown
itself out, subsided. The wind died away, and,
though there was a long swell on, the storm was
practically over. It grew a little lighter with the
dispersing of the mist.</p>

<p>The boys sized up the newcomer. The boat
was about fifty feet long, and had a small cabin.
It was operated by a gasolene motor of eight cylinders.
Beside it the <i>Dartaway</i> looked small.</p>

<p>“Are you the boys who sailed out of the cove
this evening?” asked the steersman of the <i>Three
Bells</i>.</p>

<p>“I guess we are,” Jerry replied. He had
stopped his engine, as had the skipper of the other
craft, which contained two men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“Didn’t you hear some one hail you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jerry. “We thought it was some
one wanting to race, and we weren’t in trim for a
brush. We haven’t got our boat fixed up yet, so
we decided to pay no attention to it. Was it
you?”</p>

<p>“No, it was one of the coast fishermen,” replied
the captain of the <i>Three Bells</i>.</p>

<p>“Did he want to race?” asked Ned, curious to
understand why a fisherman should want to challenge
them.</p>

<p>“Race? I guess not,” was the man’s reply.
“Why he was calling you to come back because
he saw the squall coming up. He sized you up
for newcomers at the beach, and knew you probably
didn’t know anything about the weather here.
We have some pretty bad storms, and they come
up in an instant and without warning. The fisherman
was able to see it getting ready to break, and
he didn’t want you to venture out. But it seems
you went, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and we had quite a time,” returned Jerry.
“But the <i>Dartaway</i> stood it all right.”</p>

<p>“More good luck than good management,” was
the comment. “Why, half the people at the
beach probably believe you drowned by now.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?” asked Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“The fisherman, when he saw he couldn’t catch
you, came back and gave the alarm.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if my mother is worried,” Jerry
said. “We must hurry back.”</p>

<p>“Did you come out for us?” asked Bob of the
<i>Three Bells’</i> captain.</p>

<p>“That’s what I did,” was the answer. “I
knew how risky it was out here, in a small boat, so
I hustled out after you. You must have gone a
pretty good clip, for I couldn’t catch you for some
time.”</p>

<p>“Well, the <i>Dartaway</i> has some speed,” admitted
Jerry with a little note of pride in his voice.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to enter her in the races next week.
Oh, by the way, allow me to introduce myself.
I’m Captain James Jenkinson.”</p>

<p>Jerry told his own name, and those of his companions.</p>

<p>“Well, the squall’s about over now,” said Captain
Jenkinson. “I guess it’s safe enough to go
back. Are you all right?”</p>

<p>“All except being wet through,” Ned replied.</p>

<p>“And hungry,” put in Bob, whereat his chums
laughed.</p>

<p>“I can give you a tow back,” Captain Jenkinson
went on. “We might make it a little quicker.”</p>

<p>“I guess the <i>Dartaway</i> can make it under her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
own power,” Jerry said. He was not going to
accept any assistance not really needed.</p>

<p>“All right,” Captain Jenkinson responded,
probably understanding how the boys felt. “You
can follow me in, as I can probably pick out the
best channel for you.”</p>

<p>This aid the boys had no compunctions about
accepting, and, as Jerry turned the gasolene on,
and shoved the spark lever over, the <i>Dartaway</i>
shot ahead. Jerry steered her in a curve after the
<i>Three Bells</i>, which was heading back toward the
harbor.</p>

<p>“I say!” called Captain Jenkinson.</p>

<p>“What is it?” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“If you ever come out this way again, look out
for the rocks. They’re indicated by a red and
white striped buoy for days, but the lighthouse
marks them by night. They’re bad ones, so look
out.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, we will,” shouted Bob.</p>

<p>It was now very dark, but the lights of the
<i>Three Bells</i> enabled the boys to follow her. She
made a fast pace, but the <i>Dartaway</i> was no slow
boat, and in about an hour Jerry swung his craft
into the little cove.</p>

<p>“See you to-morrow perhaps,” called Captain
Jenkinson, as he increased the speed of his craft,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
and steered toward the boathouse on the opposite
shore to where Mrs. Hopkins had her cottage.</p>

<p>“Good-bye!” shouted the boys.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the <i>Dartaway</i> was at her
dock, and three soaking wet, and somewhat tired,
but very proud boys strolled up to the cottage.</p>

<p>“Good boat we’ve got,” observed Jerry.
“Hard to beat, eh, fellows?”</p>

<p>“Now you’re talking,” said Bob. “I believe
we could cross the Atlantic in her&mdash;if we could
take along enough to eat,” he added quickly.</p>

<p>The boys found Mrs. Hopkins so busy with the
servants arranging the cottage, that she had hardly
given the lads a thought. She did not even know
they had gone out in the boat, so the storm had
not worried her. However, a number of the cottagers,
who paid more attention to the boating
affairs, had heard of the boys’ peril and were relieved
to learn they got back safely. There was
no small appreciation of their pluck, after Captain
Jenkinson had told of the affair.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Hopkins heard of it she was, at
first, much frightened over the danger the boys
had escaped. But Jerry assured her they could
look out for themselves, and, on his promise to
use all precautions thereafter in going out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
cove in the boat, his mother placed no restrictions
on his actions.</p>

<p>For three days after this the boys were kept
busy fixing up their craft. They put the new saluting
cannon in the bow, strung new rudder lines,
which had been strained during the squall, and
cleaned the engine. They were burnishing up the
brass work, one afternoon, when some one entered
the boathouse.</p>

<p>“Where are the three boy sailors?” a hearty
voice asked.</p>

<p>“Come in!” cried Jerry, and Captain Jenkinson
entered.</p>

<p>“Hard at work, eh?” he asked. “That’s
right, can’t take too much care of your boat and
engine. They do better work the more time you
put on them, and you never can tell when you may
need an extra bit of speed.”</p>

<p>Captain Jenkinson told the boys of some informal
races that had been arranged among the
owners of motor boats. There were half a dozen,
he said, who had entered their craft, and he asked
if the boys did not want to take part in the contest.</p>

<p>Of course they were delighted, and the captain
said he would arrange to have them formally entered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
The races were to take place in the cove
the next Tuesday. The course was a triangular
one, about three miles in all, and the prize was a
silver cup.</p>

<p>In the interval the boys found time to take several
short cruises. They found their craft was
working well, and, in several little impromptu contests,
they “put it all over the other boats,” to use
Bob’s expression.</p>

<p>There were seven entries for the race, including
the <i>Dartaway</i>. As Captain Jenkinson’s boat
was so powerful, and outclassed the others so
much, he did not enter but allowed the judges to
use her.</p>

<p>“Do you think we have any chance?” asked
Ned, the morning of the contest.</p>

<p>“Sure,” replied Jerry, who was going to steer.
“I don’t say we’ll win, but we’ll come near it.
You and Bob want to keep the engine well oiled.
Guess I’ll rig up a spare set of batteries, in case of
accident. I’ll have ’em ready to switch on in a
second if the magneto or the regular batteries fail.”</p>

<p>“The only boat I’m afraid of is the <i>Snail</i>,” said
Ned. “She’s just the opposite to her name, and
the other day she went way ahead of us.”</p>

<p>“Our engine wasn’t sparking good that time,”
Jerry remarked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>The race was a handicap one,&mdash;that is the boats
were graded according to the size of their cylinders
and the horse-power of the engines. This
grading made the <i>Dartaway</i> and <i>Snail</i> take fourth
place. Three other boats started off ten seconds
ahead of them, and two large boats ten seconds
after them.</p>

<p>The cove was dotted with craft the afternoon of
the race. It was hard to keep them clear of the
course, but by dint of circling around it several
times Captain Jenkinson was able to make the
owners of other boats understand he meant business.</p>

<p>At the crack of a revolver the three first boats
started off, the explosions of their engines, from
which the mufflers had been taken, sounding like a
battery of Gatling guns in full action.</p>

<p>The three boys nervously awaited the signal that
was to send them off. Jerry kept watch of those
aboard the <i>Snail</i>, which contained three youths.</p>

<p>Crack! went the pistol, and Jerry threw in the
first speed clutch, for, as in the case of the other
boats, the engine had been kept running, though
not in gear.</p>

<p>The <i>Dartaway</i> jumped ahead like a hungry fish
after a small frog. Likewise did the <i>Snail</i>, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
with the engines working almost at full speed the
two rival craft surged through the water.</p>

<p>Side by side they kept. Jerry threw in second
gear and the captain of the <i>Snail</i> did likewise.
Jerry decided to run on that for a while, and trust
to the power of the motor, which Ned and Bob
were looking after.</p>

<p>Jerry dimly heard the revolver shot that sent the
two last boats off. But he did not care for them.
He wanted to overhaul those in the lead. This he
seemed in a fair way to be able to do. None of
the craft was speedy, and, though their ten seconds
start gave them an advantage, the <i>Dartaway</i> was
soon close to the rear one.</p>

<p>Notch by notch Jerry gave the engine more
gasolene, and, notch by notch he advanced the
spark lever. He was crouching down low, as were
the other boys, to offer less resistance to the wind.
Slowly the <i>Dartaway</i> was creeping up to one of
the leading boats, and a little later passed it. Then
it overhauled another.</p>

<p>Just as the first leg of the triangular course was
rounded Jerry threw in the third speed, and shut
off a little of the power. At the same instant he
passed the last one of the three boats that had
gotten off first and the <i>Dartaway</i> was now in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
lead. A thrill possessed him. The <i>Dartaway</i>
might win.</p>

<p>But, as he turned his head, he saw that the <i>Snail</i>
had also crept up, until, passing the others, it was
on even terms with the boys’ boat. The <i>Dartaway</i>
was not going to have things her own way.</p>

<p>Jerry had no thought for the other craft now.
It was a contest with the <i>Snail</i> only. The two
boats were evenly matched and those aboard knew
best how to get the speed out of them.</p>

<p>It was bow and bow between the two, almost to
the second stake. Then Jerry slightly advanced
the spark lever and the <i>Dartaway</i> shot ahead.
Only for an instant, however, as the <i>Snail</i> was right
after her.</p>

<p>“I’d like to lose her,” thought Jerry.</p>

<p>He gave one look behind him. The two boats
which had started last were close up, but Jerry
had no fear of them. The engine of one, he could
tell by the sound, was missing explosions, and the
other was wheezing and coughing in a way that
indicated loss of power. It was now a race between
the <i>Dartaway</i> and the <i>Snail</i>.</p>

<p>They were on the last leg. Jerry could hear the
shouts of the excited spectators. It was a race
worth seeing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“Douse her with oil,” called Jerry. “On the
bearings, only, don’t flood the cylinders!”</p>

<p>Ned and Bob were busy over the machinery.
Jerry was holding the wheel firmly, watching, from
the corner of his eyes, the progress of the <i>Snail</i>.
He thought he saw her falling back a little, and
he used a little of his reserve power.</p>

<p>Suddenly, with a wheeze that sent a chill to
the hearts of the boys, the <i>Dartaway’s</i> engine
ceased to work, and the <i>Snail</i> shot ahead.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>“THERE SHE BLOWS”</small></h2>


<p>“What’s the matter?” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“Don’t know,” replied Bob. “Something’s
broken.”</p>

<p>“It’s the batteries or magneto,” Ned exclaimed.
“There’s no spark!”</p>

<p>“Quick! Throw on the new set of batteries
I put in,” called Jerry. “Lively now! Maybe
she’ll explode without cranking!”</p>

<p>Bob shoved over the switch that Jerry had provided
for just such an emergency. There was a
click, a little spurt of green fire as the two pieces
of copper came together, and, with a sound like
a gun, the engine resumed its revolutions. A
charge in one of the cylinders had exploded, and
had turned the fly wheel over, just in time to render
it unnecessary to crank up.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! She’s off!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>With a quick motion Jerry threw the engine back
on first speed, as he wanted to give it a chance to
work up before he called on it for a harder effort.</p>

<p>But the accident was likely to prove dear to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
<i>Dartaway</i>. One of the boats in the rear had almost
caught up to her, and the <i>Snail</i> was a good
five lengths ahead.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to strain everything now,” said
Jerry grimly. “It’s a small chance but we’ll take
it.”</p>

<p>Quickly he speeded up the engine, giving the
cylinders all the gasolene they would take, and he
also began to advance the spark.</p>

<p>As soon as he could he threw in the third speed
gear. The <i>Dartaway</i> responded nobly, and fairly
shot through the water. The <i>Snail’s</i> lead was cut
down by one length.</p>

<p>One advantage the accident gave was the bringing
into use of fresh batteries. This gave a better
and hotter spark, and rendered the explosions
more powerful. Jerry saw this, and his heart rejoiced.</p>

<p>Notch by notch he shoved the two levers around
and the boat increased her speed. Those in the
<i>Snail</i> looked back apprehensively.</p>

<p>“We’ll catch you yet,” Jerry murmured.
“How’s she running, Ned?”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t be better.”</p>

<p>“Don’t spare the oil, and keep low down.
We’re right against the wind now, and everything
counts.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Slowly but surely the <i>Dartaway</i> was overhauling
the <i>Snail</i>. Inch by inch she crept up. Now
the leading boat was but two lengths ahead. But
the last stake was close at hand. Five minutes
more and the race would be over. There was a
big lead to cut down in a short time.</p>

<p>Jerry shut his teeth tightly. It was if he, himself,
was running the race, and was determined to
win or die. He gave one look towards the stake-boat
and another at <i>Snail</i>, and then shoved the
sparking lever over as far as he dared, at the same
time giving the cylinders the utmost gasolene they
could take without being choked and floated.</p>

<p>It was the last effort, the utter limit to which
the <i>Dartaway</i> could be pushed.</p>

<p>The craft responded, as if knowing what was
required of her. She seemed to rise like a bird
under the increased impulse, and to fairly skim
over the water. She darted ahead, and, with
hearts that beat high with hope, the boys saw her
creep past the stern of the <i>Snail</i>, until the bows
of the two boats were once more even.</p>

<p>The stake was three hundred feet ahead. The
<i>Dartaway</i> must do an inch or two better if she
was to win. Those aboard the <i>Snail</i> were doing
their utmost to get another revolution or two
from their engine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Jerry and his companions almost held their
breaths. They peered over the side to see what
their rivals were doing. They saw them frantically
oiling the levers and cams.</p>

<p>“Only an inch! Only an inch!” Jerry whispered
under his breath. “Only an inch and we
can beat ’em!”</p>

<p>Then, whether it was that the <i>Dartaway</i> heard
the cry and responded, or whether the <i>Snail’s</i> engine
went back on the boat, no one could tell, but
the <i>Dartaway</i> shot ahead, several inches. There
was an exultant cheer from the three boys. There
was a corresponding groan from those on the
<i>Snail</i>. There was a great shout from the spectators.</p>

<p>An instant later the <i>Dartaway</i> crossed the line
a winner.</p>

<p>What a shrill tooting of whistles there was!
What a chorus of shouts and yells! What a
sound of gasolene engines exploding on all sides
to add to the din.</p>

<p><em>Bang!</em> it was a cannon on the <i>Three Bells</i>, fired
in honor of the victor.</p>

<p><em>Bang!</em> spoke the <i>Dartaway’s</i> ordnance in reply.</p>

<p>Then there were more cheers and yells. Jerry,
in answer to a signal, slowed down his craft and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
put it over to the <i>Three Bells</i>, where the judges
were. The <i>Snail</i> followed.</p>

<p>“A good race and well managed,” said Captain
Jenkinson. “I thought you boys were out
of it when your engine stopped. How did you
manage it?”</p>

<p>Jerry told him of the extra batteries, and was
congratulated for his forethought.</p>

<p>“You certainly have a fine boat,” the captain
of the <i>Snail</i> said, as he shook hands with Jerry and
his chums. “You beat us fairly and squarely.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and here’s your reward,” said Captain
Jenkinson, as he handed Jerry a beautiful silver
cup. “May it be an incentive to you and your
comrades to win many more races.”</p>

<p>“Speech! Speech!” cried several. The
judges’ boat was surrounded by a score of craft,
which hemmed in the <i>Dartaway</i> and the <i>Snail</i>.</p>

<p>“I can’t make a speech,” Jerry stammered.
“But I want to thank you all for allowing us to
take part in this race, and if any one wants to
have another try for the cup, why he can, that’s
all.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” yelled the crowd.</p>

<p>“I may take you up on that offer,” said Captain
Jones, owner of the <i>Snail</i>. “I believe I can beat
you yet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re welcome to try,” Jerry answered.</p>

<p>The boys were hardly able to realize their good
luck. They had snatched the race from defeat,
and the skillful way in which they had managed
their boat brought them much praise.</p>

<p>There were several other aquatic events that
afternoon. It was a sort of opening of the summer
season at Harmon Beach, which was quite a
resort for those who loved the sea. The boys
did not stay long, however, as Jerry was anxious
to show his mother the cup he and his chums had
won.</p>

<p>As the boys were fastening their boat to the
dock, they heard a noise in the shelter house. At
first they thought it might be Mrs. Hopkins, who
had come down to meet them. But they heard a
hoarse voice singing:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Oh it’s blow, blow, blow!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And to Davy’s locker we’ll go.<br /></span>
<span class="i5">For a stormy night<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Is my delight;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And I love the hail and snow!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>An instant later a short, stout man, with one
eye, a grizzled beard, rather ragged clothes, the
trousers of which he kept hitching up, while he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
rolled his lone optic around in a strange fashion,
came out on the dock from the boathouse.</p>

<p>“What ho! my hearties!” he cried. “Avast,
messmates!”</p>

<p>“Who are you?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Salt Water Sam. A relic of the deep seas.”</p>

<p>“Glad to see you,” remarked Bob. The lads
took the old man for a harmless character, and
paid little attention to him. For a while Salt
Water Sam regarded the boys with his one eye,
and then, singing his verse once more, he walked
off with a rolling gait.</p>

<p>“Old sailor,” said Ned. “I’d like to know
him.”</p>

<p>“You’ll probably have a chance. He seems to
make himself at home,” remarked Jerry.</p>

<p>For several days after this the boys only made
short trips about the cove in their boat. They
took Mrs. Hopkins out, and she enjoyed the little
cruises very much. Jerry wanted to take her
out on the ocean but she would not hear of it.
She said she was afraid the boat would swamp.</p>

<p>“You’d ought to have been with us the other
night,” said Jerry. “I guess that would have
scared you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you ever take such risks again,” cautioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Mrs. Hopkins, and the boys promised they
would not. But boys are very forgetful.</p>

<p>The <i>Dartaway</i> was now fully equipped “from
anchors to apricots,” as Bob said. He had superintended
putting aboard a quantity of provisions
including the canned fruit which, he said, could
be used in case of emergency.</p>

<p>One afternoon, as the boys were cruising near
shore, they saw a fisherman’s boat come in. It
was the kind of craft with a small engine, called
a “kicker,” in it, to be used in case of calm.</p>

<p>As it tied up alongside of a small public dock,
the boys could see, by the manner of the men,
that something had happened. They were much
excited.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” they heard several ask.</p>

<p>“There’s a whale off shore,” replied the captain.
“We found our nets all ripped up, and,
as we were wondering what did it, we saw a big
whale spout, close by.”</p>

<p>“What’s that? A whale?” cried a hoarse
voice, and the boys saw Salt Water Sam come rolling
down to the dock. “A whale! Shiver my
timbers, there she blows!” he cried, seeming to
get excited at the mention of the name. “Let
me get at him. Many a one I’ve harpooned!”</p>
</div>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>AFTER THE WHALE</small></h2>


<p>There was considerable excitement on the
dock. The news soon spread that one of the
monsters of the deep had been sighted off the
beach, and a number of boats were gotten ready
to go out for a glimpse of the whale.</p>

<p>“Here’s our chance,” said Ned. “Why can’t
we go out and have a look at him? I never saw
a whale in the ocean.”</p>

<p>“Neither did I, nor anywhere else,” Jerry replied.
“I guess we can go.”</p>

<p>“Hi there!” hailed a voice, and the boys saw
the old sailor beckoning to them. “Avast! I
want to speak to you. Avast! Belay!”</p>

<p>“Shall we see what he wants?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>The old man was dancing about on the dock,
hitching his trousers up so often that Bob remarked
he would wear them out in a short time at
that rate. His one eye was rolling about trying
to see in half a dozen directions at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>“Can’t do any harm to learn what he wants,”
Ned replied. “Put her over, Jerry.”</p>

<p>Accordingly the <i>Dartaway</i> was steered toward
the dock, on which there were quite a number of
persons. Several were getting boats ready to go
off and get a view of the big creature.</p>

<p>“Steady now, my hearties!” exclaimed the old
sailor. “That’s the way to do it! Couldn’t
have done it any better myself!” as Jerry brought
the boat up alongside of the dock without hitting
the string piece.</p>

<p>“Did you call us?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Sure, son, I want you to take me out so we
can kill that whale. Shiver my timbers, but it’s
like old times again!”</p>

<p>“Did you ever kill whales?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Did I? Say you don’t know me!”</p>

<p>Then, rolling up his sleeves and disclosing two
very hairy and much tattooed arms he sang in a
high, quavering voice:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I’ve traveled in the North sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I’ve traveled in the South.<br /></span>
<span class="i5">I’ve killed a whale<br /></span>
<span class="i5">With the biggest tail<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the smallest kind of a mouth!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“That’s me! That’s Salt Water Sam!” he
went on. “Now boys, if you wait a minute I’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
go after my harpoon and line, and we’ll have a
whale chase as is a chase.”</p>

<p>Before the boys could reply, the old sailor ran
from the dock toward a little shanty that stood
on the beach. When he was gone Jerry asked:</p>

<p>“Shall we risk it, fellows?”</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s only joking?” Bob said. “He
doesn’t look as if he knew how to harpoon a
whale.”</p>

<p>“Let’s take him along, anyhow,” Ned put in.
“He’ll know a lot about the ocean, and we can
ask him about the lighthouses and the rocks, even
if we don’t see him kill a whale.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes the old man came back again.
On his head he carried a tub, while over his
shoulder was a long pole. He ran down to the
dock with a speed surprising in so old a person.</p>

<p>“There she is!” he cried, as he reached the
boat. “There’s the iron that sent many a good
whale, and some bad ones, too, maybe, to the
boiling kettles. There she is!”</p>

<p>It was a harpoon that he had; an old implement,
and one that had seen service, to judge by
the look of it. It was rusty, and the wooden
handle was full of notches.</p>

<p>“Them’s the number of whales she’s been
into,” said Salt Water Sam, proudly, pointing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the cuts. “I did every one myself. And this
tub and line&mdash;well they’ve seen service, just the
same as their owner. They’re old but you can
depend on ’em.”</p>

<p>While he was speaking he had boarded the
boat, and was arranging the tub, with its coil of
line in the bottom, at the bow. Then he sat
down near Ned, and, taking out a file, began
sharpening the barb of the harpoon.</p>

<p>“Let her go, skipper,” said Sam, to Jerry, and,
at a nod from the latter, Bob cranked the engine,
and the <i>Dartaway</i> was steered out toward the
open sea.</p>

<p>“Any danger of a storm?” asked Ned, of the
old sailor. He did not want to get caught as
they had been before.</p>

<p>“Clear as a bell, and it’ll stay so ’till dog
watch,” the sailor replied, not looking up from
the delicate operation of putting a finer point on
his weapon.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we’ll see very little of the whale,”
remarked Bob. “All the other boats are ahead
of us, and they’ll scare him off so we’ll miss him.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let that worry you, sonny,” said Sam.
“Trust an old whaleman to find the creatures if
they’re within seeing distance. Put her right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
between the two points, lad, there’s less current
there, and you’ll skim along like one of Mother
Carey’s chickens,” he added to Jerry.</p>

<p>Jerry speeded up the engine, and the <i>Dartaway</i>
fairly flew through the water. Ahead was quite
a flotilla of sail and motor boats, crowded with
persons anxious to get a view of the sea monster.</p>

<p>“It’s a sweet little craft you have here, lads,”
Sam remarked, having satisfied himself that the
harpoon was sharp enough. “Almost as fast as
the <i>Dolly Gray</i>, in which I made my first voyage
to the whaling grounds. Ah, but she was a
lovely schooner.”</p>

<p>Sam now began fastening the line to the
weapon. He took great care in this, and Ned
and Bob watched him curiously. Then he saw to
it that the line was properly coiled in the tub.</p>

<p>“Can’t be too careful,” the sailor remarked.
“If it snarls why it’s all up with the whale and
you, too.”</p>

<p>“Is there going to be any danger?” asked
Bob, in some alarm.</p>

<p>“Not with Salt Water Sam aboard,” was the
sailor’s reply. “You leave it to me.”</p>

<p>By this time the <i>Dartaway</i> was up with the last
of the boats, and, a little later had overhauled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
some of them. Ten minutes more and she had
passed the points of the harbor and the boys
found themselves out on the open Atlantic.</p>

<p>The water was calm, and there was scarcely a
breeze to ruffle the surface. There was a long
gentle swell, but the lads soon became used to this.</p>

<p>“Now, boys,” said Sam, “if you’ll do as I tell
you we’ll be all right. I’m going to stand in the
bow, and, skipper, you send her forward or back,
as I tell you. If we strike the whale you want to
send her astern like lightning, or there’ll be a
mess.”</p>

<p>“Aye aye, sir!” answered Jerry, somewhat inclined
to laugh at the old man’s earnestness.</p>

<p>“That’s the way to talk,” said Sam. “Put
her out a little more, skipper. I want to clear
some of these craft.”</p>

<p>Jerry manœuvred so as to round a number of
other power boats, which seemed to be headed for
one spot. They were evidently steering for where
the whale had last been seen.</p>

<p>“He was headed up the coast,” Sam
murmured. “We’ll point up that way, and
maybe we can land him before the others scare
him away.”</p>

<p>It was here that the old sailor’s knowledge of
whales and their ways stood him in good stead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
He knew the creature would not merely float
around on the water, but would dive, and swim
beneath the surface. He had made inquiries and
learned that the monster was headed up the coast.</p>

<p>The <i>Dartaway</i> was now comparatively alone,
there being no other boats within a quarter of a
mile. The rest were hovering near where the
big creature had been seen to go down.</p>

<p>“If he comes up under one of those boats it
will be all day with ’em,” observed Ned.</p>

<p>Salt Water Sam was standing in the bow, beside
Jerry, who was at the wheel. The old man
peered ahead with his one keen eye. He was as
still as though the carved figurehead of a vessel;
every muscle was tense, every nerve on the alert.
The joy of battle shone in his face.</p>

<p>Suddenly, just ahead of the <i>Dartaway</i>, there
was a commotion in the water. It seemed to
boil and bubble. Then something big and black
was flung up from the hidden depths.</p>

<p>At the same instant two thin columns of water
shot up from the surface of the ocean. Up and
up they went, sparkling in the sun.</p>

<p>“There she blows! There she blows!” yelled
Sam. “Send her ahead, boys!”</p>

<p>With hearts that beat hard and fast in the excitement
of the moment, the three boys stood up
to catch a glimpse of the ocean monster. It was
the first whale they had ever seen, and they never
had expected to view one in its native element.</p>

<p>Jerry’s hand trembled so he could scarcely send
the sparking lever forward, to increase the speed
of the craft. As it clicked over the rachet the
<i>Dartaway</i> shot ahead. Sam, standing up in the
bow, poised his arm to hurl the harpoon. Then,
as though alarmed by the approach of the boat,
and probably mistrusting the throbbing of the engine,
the whale “sounded.”</p>

<p>With a turn of its massive flukes, it sunk
downward into the depths whence it had emerged
but a few minutes before to breathe.</p>

<p>“He’s gone!” exclaimed Bob.</p>

<p>“Quiet!” cautioned Sam. “That’s nothing.”
He was speaking in a whisper. “Got to expect
that. We’ll land him yet. Put her a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
further out, skipper, and stand ready to go astern
when I give the word.”</p>

<p>Slowing down the engine, Jerry steered the
boat in obedience to motions from Sam’s hand.
The old man kept his eye fixed on the water, as
though he could see into the depths, and watch the
whale coursing forward.</p>

<p>Whether he could or not his instinct seemed to
tell him about where the creature would rise.
The <i>Dartaway</i> had been sailing along not more
than ten minutes when again came that curious
boiling and bubbling of the water.</p>

<p>This time it was off to the left, about a quarter
of a mile away. There was no need to tell Jerry
in which direction to steer. He increased the
speed of the engine, and was darting toward the
spot, when once more the whale spouted.</p>

<p>“There she blows!” cried Bob, unable to
withhold his enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Easy now,” cautioned Sam. “We don’t
want to frighten him again. Put me close,
skipper.”</p>

<p>Jerry slowed down the motor, so as to make
less noise and threw the wheel over. Nearer and
nearer the craft approached the big creature, that
was resting easily on the surface of the ocean.</p>

<p>But again they were doomed to disappointment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
They were within a short distance of the
monster, but not close enough to enable Sam to
throw the harpoon, when the whale, with a mighty
blow of its flukes, which raised a wave that
careened the <i>Dartaway</i>, sank into the depths.</p>

<p>“We’ll never get him!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“Leave it to Salt Water Sam,” was the old
man’s reply.</p>

<p>Once more he scanned the water with his keen
eye. Again Jerry, obeying the motions of his
hand, sent the boat forward. The boys were now
quite a distance from shore, and there was no
other craft near them. The flotilla of boats was
two miles away, still cruising around where the
whale had first been seen, and the occupants looking
for the monster were too far off to see what
those in the <i>Dartaway</i> were about.</p>

<p>“Get ready!” came the old sailor’s voice, and,
once more the boys’ hearts beat violently. Sam
motioned for Jerry to steer the boat to the right.
Hardly had the direction been changed than again
there was that curious bubbling, and the whale
spouted for the third time.</p>

<p>“He must be hurt!” said Sam, in a low tone.
“Or else he wouldn’t come up so often to breathe.
I think I can land him this time. Easy now!
Right for him, skipper!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>Jerry was calmer now. He held the wheel
steadily, and his hands did not tremble as he
shoved the levers over. Old Sam gave a last
look at the coils of line in the tub to see that they
were free.</p>

<p>Closer and closer to the monster the boat approached.
The boys could see the black sides
glistening in the sun. It seemed that the whale
was a thousand feet long, though as Sam told
them afterward, it was only one of the smallest
species. But to the boys it was large enough.</p>

<p>At a signal from the old man, Jerry shut off the
engine, almost completely, giving it just enough
gasolene to keep it from being stalled. His
hand was on the reverse lever, ready to throw in
the clutch, and then to start the motor at full speed
astern.</p>

<p>The <i>Dartaway</i> was merely under enough power
to give her steerage way. Sam, by a nod of his
head, indicated to Jerry to approach the whale
broadside on, as they were now coming up to the
monster’s tail. One blow from the mighty flukes,
and there would be no boat left.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer to the creature the <i>Dartaway</i>
was sent. Now it was within one hundred
feet. Now it was seventy-five. Still the whale
had not taken fright. The boys could hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
breathe from the fierce beating of their hearts.</p>

<p>As for Sam, he was as cool as though he was
about to pull in a small fish which he had hooked.
He stood rigid in the bow, the terrible harpoon
poised over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Suddenly his arm shot forward. There was a
whistling sound, a hissing through the air.
Something flew from the boat, and struck the
whale.</p>

<p>The next instant the boys saw, sticking up from
the whale’s back, a straight shaft. It was the
handle of the harpoon. The iron had entered
deep into the flesh.</p>

<p>“Hard astern!” yelled Sam. “Astern for
your lives!”</p>

<p>Jerry never moved more quickly than he did
to throw the reverse gear in, and send the gasolene
and sparking levers over. With a splutter
and roar the motor got into action, and the <i>Dartaway</i>
began to back.</p>

<p>And only just in time, for the whale fairly
leaped out of the water from the pain of the iron.
Then it brought its great flukes down on the surface,
sending up a shower of spray that soaked the
occupants of the boat.</p>

<p>The line began to run from the tub and over
an improvised roller Sam had fastened in the bow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
So rapidly did it spin out that the bearings began
to smoke, and the old sailor dipped up water in a
tin can and began pouring it over the wood, to
prevent it from catching fire.</p>

<p>“Struck good and deep!” he cried. “Old
Sam is some good yet.”</p>

<p>The engine was still running on the reverse,
but, in a few minutes the boys noticed that they
were going forward.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>At that the last of the line was out of the tub,
but before then it had been quickly caught around
a cleat, by Sam.</p>

<p>“We’re being towed out to sea,” the old sailor
said. “Don’t be afraid. It’s what I expected.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>THE WHALE ESCAPES</small></h2>


<p>“Towed out to sea?” inquired Ned.</p>

<p>The words had a sort of terror in them. The
boys looked at one another.</p>

<p>“Land love you, yes,” went on the old whaler,
who seemed as happy as a lad at a picnic. “It
isn’t the first time I’ve been towed by a whale.
That’s the way they do, sometimes. But they soon
tire of it, and then we’ll have another chance at
him.”</p>

<p>“But isn’t it dangerous?” asked Jerry, who
did not exactly like the idea.</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” replied Sam. “That is, if you
cut the line in time, in case the whale sounds.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Why, sometimes they’ll take a notion to go
down before you know it. Then, if you don’t cut
the line in time, they’re liable to swamp the boat.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we’d better cut it now,” suggested
Bob.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” exclaimed Sam. “Why it’s only
just begun. There’s no danger yet. I remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
once we was towed nearly a day with a whale in
the North Sea. I was mate of the <i>Dogstar</i> then,
as fine a craft as I ever saw. But she was wrecked
on an iceberg and I was the only one saved. That
was a voyage!” and the old man’s eye sparkled
in remembrance.</p>

<p>“How far will he take us?” asked Jerry, not a
little anxious on his mother’s account.</p>

<p>“No telling,” replied Sam. “Twenty or thirty
miles, maybe. But you have one advantage we
didn’t have in the old whale boats. You can
keep the engine going at reverse, and make a drag
that will soon tire him out. That’s a good thing.”</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that the motor was revolving
the screw backward, the whale seemed to
have no difficulty in pulling the <i>Dartaway</i> after
him. He fairly made the craft fly through the
water.</p>

<p>Right out to sea, the motor boat was headed.
The beach had long since been left astern, and the
other boats could only be dimly seen.</p>

<p>There was nothing to do but to sit and wait for
the whale to tire itself out. Sam seemed to accept
this as a matter of course. He had brought
a lance along, in addition to his harpoon, and was
now sharpening this keen weapon, in anticipation
of making a death thrust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>As for the boys, they viewed with alarm the
ever increasing distance from shore. The beach
was now but an indistinct hazy line.</p>

<p>“Maybe we’d better give it up,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“Why, are you getting hungry, Chunky?”
asked Jerry.</p>

<p>Ned’s laugh at this sally seemed to relieve their
feelings somewhat, and, when Sam told them he
would only hold on a little while longer, in case
they were still alarmed, they felt better.</p>

<p>“We can’t come to any harm,” the old sailor
said. “No matter how far we go we can get
back, and we’ll not have to row, either, the way
we did in the old days.”</p>

<p>“But it’s a good distance to go to sea in a small
boat,” objected Bob.</p>

<p>“This is big enough to cross the Atlantic in,”
said the sailor. “All you want is plenty to eat.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ve got that,” Bob replied, brightening
up, somewhat at the remembrance of the well filled
lockers.</p>

<p>“Then don’t worry,” advised Salt Water Sam.
“It’s a fine day and no sign of a storm.”</p>

<p>Then the boys decided to accept the situation.
They knew they could make good time back, in
their craft, and Jerry did not believe his mother
would worry. Besides she had no idea that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
had gone whaling. If she had, she might have
been alarmed.</p>

<p>Then, too, there was something fascinating in
the idea of being attached to a monster of the
deep. The boys realized it was an experience
they might never have again, though, for that
matter, it is doubtful if they ever wanted it.</p>

<p>So, for an hour longer they sat in the boat and
watched the waves rushing past them. As the reversing
of the engine seemed to have no slackening
effect on the whale’s progress, Jerry decided to
shut the motor off, and so save gasolene.</p>

<p>Now and then Sam would stand up in the bow
and take an observation. The boys could see
nothing but the long, thin line extending from the
craft and disappearing beneath the water.</p>

<p>“He’s still there,” said the old sailor, as if
there could be any doubt of it with the way the
boat was speeding through the water. “I can see
him, almost on the surface. He’s going a lively
clip.”</p>

<p>Bob got up from where he had been seated and
began rummaging about in the locker.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“I’m hungry,” announced Chunky. “Got to
have something to eat.”</p>

<p>“That’s not a bad idea,” Sam put in. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
didn’t have much dinner myself, and salt air
always makes me have an appetite.”</p>

<p>Thus finding an ally, Bob proceeded to get out
the victuals. He lighted the gasolene stove and
made coffee, which with some sandwiches and
canned stuff, provided a meal that made up in zest
what it lacked in quality.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet it’s the first time this whale ever towed
a dinner party,” said Jerry between bites.</p>

<p>“I hope it’ll be the last,” murmured Sam. “I
want to get my lance into him. There’s a pot of
money in it, even if he isn’t a spermer. We can
land him on the beach and charge ten cents admission
to see him, though it’s not in my line.”</p>

<p>It was about ten minutes later when Jerry,
glancing at the line, noticed it was slack. He
called Sam’s attention to it.</p>

<p>“He’s up to some trick,” the old sailor remarked,
as he peered anxiously forward. “Going
to sound, or maybe he’s headed this way.”</p>

<p>The boys looked at each other. Here was a
new complication. It was one thing to chase a
whale. It was altogether another to have the
process reversed and the monster turn pursuer.</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to wait and see what he’s up to,”
Sam replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>“Suppose he comes for us?”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll have to run. That’s the only safe
rule,” and Sam smiled grimly.</p>

<p>The <i>Dartaway</i> was now rocking easily on the
waves. The sea remained calm, and, as the sailor
remarked, was like a “mill pond on a summer
day.” The line from the bow lay slack on the
water.</p>

<p>“He’s sulking,” muttered Sam, as he stood up,
trying to catch a glimpse of the monster.</p>

<p>An instant later it seemed as if a big wave was
coming toward the boat. There was a roll of
green water, advancing nearer and nearer.</p>

<p>“He’s headed for us!” cried Sam. “Quick!
Start the engine and get away!”</p>

<p>Bob dropped his sandwich and sprang to the
fly wheel. He cranked it, praying silently that
the explosion might come quickly.</p>

<p>Jerry had thrown the forward gear in, and
turned on the gasolene and spark. There sounded
a welcome “chug,” and an instant later the engine
was working at rapid speed.</p>

<p>Jerry put the wheel over, and headed the boat
away from the on-coming whale. The line, fast
to the bow, swung over the stern, lengthwise of
the craft, nearly carrying Ned overboard in the
rapid change it made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Dartaway</i> was off like an arrow from the
bow, piling up a line of foam at the cut-water.
The big wave at the back was nearer now. It
was caused by the water gathering in front of the
whale’s blunt, massive head.</p>

<p>“Can we get away?” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to try!” shouted Sam. “Put a
little more speed on, skipper!”</p>

<p>The boat forged ahead faster than before.
Sam stood up, peering aft to see if the whale
gained. There was no doubt that the monster
was nearer, in spite of the fast whirling propellor.
For once the <i>Dartaway</i> had met her match in a
speed contest.</p>

<p>“Can’t you get any more out of her?” called
the sailor in an anxious voice.</p>

<p>“No,” said Jerry, his heart sinking.</p>

<p>“He’ll ram us and sink us!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“Veer off a bit!” yelled Sam. “Maybe he’ll
rush past us, and we can slip away.”</p>

<p>Jerry shifted the wheel, to allow the whale to
pass on the left, if it would, in its maddened rush.
The sailor armed himself with a small hatchet
and his lance.</p>

<p>As the boat swung around the line passed from
the stern to the bow. It had been slack, but now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
it grew taut again, and the old sailor, watching
it, sought for an explanation.</p>

<p>It was easily found. The whale had ceased
its rush at the boat, and, passing to one side, was
moving forward again. Then, as though trying
a last resort to rid itself of the harpoon, it suddenly
sank. Down and down into the ocean
depths it went.</p>

<p>The bow of the <i>Dartaway</i> began to be depressed.
Lower and lower it went into the water,
until the screw was revolving in the air.</p>

<p>“He’ll pull us down with him!” yelled Jerry.</p>

<p>“No, he won’t!” cried Sam.</p>

<p>There was a sharp sound, a snap as though a
whip had cracked and the end of the line flew
up in the air. Sam had cut it with his hatchet,
and the whale had escaped its enemies. The
bow of the boat righted, and the craft floated on an
even keel, moving forward at a fast pace.</p>

<small>ADRIFT ON THE OCEAN</small></h2>


<p>“That’s the end of Mr. Whale,” remarked
Sam, in somewhat sorrowful tones, as he looked
at the trailing end of the severed rope. “There
goes the best line I ever had, and a harpoon I
wouldn’t have lost for a lot of money.”</p>

<p>“Maybe the whale will die from the wound,”
said Jerry. “Anyway, he came near making an
end of us.”</p>

<p>“So he did,” replied Sam, brightening up.
“It was the only thing to do. Maybe I got the
iron in deep enough, but I didn’t see any blood
and that’s the way to tell.”</p>

<p>“Shall we put back now?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“I s’pose we might as well. Can’t do anything
more here. Where’s your compass? and
I’ll lay a course for you. It’s getting so hazy,
and we’ve twisted and turned so I can’t tell where
the beach is.”</p>

<p>“Get out the compass, Bob,” called Jerry.</p>

<p>“Compass? I haven’t got the thing,” Bob replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>“Course you have. I gave it to you the other
day, when we were fixing up the boat, and you
told me you put it in the locker.”</p>

<p>“I don’t remember,” Bob replied.</p>

<p>“I saw you have it,” Ned said. “It was the
new one, in a round metal case.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that!” exclaimed Chunky. “Was that
the compass! I thought it was a can of peas or
something like that.”</p>

<p>“Well, never mind what you thought it was,
hand it over,” Jerry said.</p>

<p>“Why, I didn’t put it in the locker,” Bob answered.</p>

<p>“You didn’t put it in!” exclaimed Ned.
“What in the world did you do with it?”</p>

<p>“Why, I thought we had enough canned peas
on board, and I left it in the boathouse until our
supply would run low. It’s there now, on a
shelf. I thought it was something to eat.”</p>

<p>“Well, you are the limit, Chunky!” exclaimed
Jerry. “I always knew your eating habits
would make trouble and now they have, sure
enough.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t help it,” Bob said trying to think
of some defense. “Why didn’t you tell me it
wasn’t anything to eat?”</p>

<p>“Hereafter I’ll label everything I hand you,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
spoke Jerry sarcastically. “You’re not safe
aboard a boat!”</p>

<p>“No compass, eh?” questioned the old sailor.
“Well, maybe one of you have one for a watch
charm, that would answer?”</p>

<p>But none of the boys had. The old sailor cast
his eye toward the clouds, that were beginning to
gather, and looked across the waste of waters.
The haze was thickening.</p>

<p>“Are we in any danger?” asked Bob, his
voice showing how anxious he felt.</p>

<p>“Well, not right away,” replied Sam. “Still
it’s going to be a risk to go in any direction. We
may hit the shore and we may not. We may go
farther out to sea than would be safe, and we
might run up on the rocks. It’s a ticklish position
to be in. I remember one like it when I was
second mate on the <i>Rolling Porpoise</i>. We were
cruising around three days, without a drop to
drink or anything to eat, before we found the ship
that was hidden by the fog.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got plenty to eat and lots of water to
drink,” said Bob. “That’s one comfort.”</p>

<p>“And a mighty good one it is, when you’re lost
at sea,” put in Sam.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t call us lost, would you?” asked
Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know what else it is,” the sailor replied.
“We don’t know which way to go, and
that’s as near lost as I want to be.”</p>

<p>“It’s your fault, Bob,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“Needn’t rub it in, though,” came from
Chunky, in aggrieved tones.</p>

<p>“We’ll do the best we can,” spoke Sam. “You
trust to me and I’ll bring you out of this if possible.”</p>

<p>But, though Sam made light of the plight they
were in, it was not one to be easily passed over.
The party was in a good boat, a craft that had
been tried on the open sea, and which had proven
its stability. The <i>Dartaway</i> was indeed a craft
of which to be proud. But the boys were farther
out on the deep than they had been during
the squall. Though it was now calm, there was
no telling how long it would remain so, and the
increasing haze seemed to promise a spell of bad
weather.</p>

<p>“Let’s make everything snug,” suggested Sam.
“That’s the first thing to do. How about
lights? We’ll have to show ’em after dark, to
avoid being run down.”</p>

<p>“We have them,” said Jerry. “Why, are we
in any danger of collision?”</p>

<p>“Well, we’re not exactly in the path of steamers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
that go up and down the coast,” the sailor replied,
“but there’s no telling when one will come
along. Best to prepare for ’em.”</p>

<p>Under his direction the boys made fast all loose
gear. Jerry looked to the engine, found there
was plenty of gasolene in the tank, and saw that
the awning posts were well secured. The covering
was up, but the side curtains had not yet been
let down. Then the red and green lights were
set aglow, as, though it would not be dark for
some time, Sam said they ought to do as much as
possible by daylight. There was no carbide for
the search light, but they did not think they would
need it.</p>

<p>It was almost dark when all their preparations
had been completed, and Sam took a long look
around to see if he could, through the haze, make
out anything that would serve for a mark to steer
by. But it was impossible.</p>

<p>“Maybe I can get a glimpse of the stars,” he
said. “Once I get my eye on the dipper I’m
all right.”</p>

<p>“I thought it was the north star that sailors
steered by,” spoke Ned.</p>

<p>“So it is, son, but there are two stars in the
bowl of the dipper, called the pointers, that are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
right in line with the north star. Get your eye
on them pointers, and you can tell where the
north star is easier than if you don’t see the big
ladle,” and Sam began tightening anew some
ropes which did not just suit him.</p>

<p>But even the stars were blotted out by the curtain
of mist and Sam’s hopes were blighted.
However, he made the best of it.</p>

<p>“I’ll risk it by the wind,” he said.</p>

<p>“How’s that?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“It’s generally blowing off shore at this time
of night. If we keep the breeze in our faces we
may strike the beach.”</p>

<p>Accordingly the <i>Dartaway</i> was headed into the
teeth of the wind, and the engine regulated to
moderate speed. Through the darkness the craft
sped over the waters. It was now night, and
though the boys tried not to show their nervousness,
they did not succeed very well.</p>

<p>It was one thing to be out in their boat all
night on a lake or river. They knew in a case
like that they were in no immediate danger. But
out on the ocean after dark, in a small craft, and
not knowing their position, was a more serious
proposition. Besides, there seemed to be something
“scary” in the mere thought of the vastness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
of the sea, the great depths, the monsters
that inhabited it, and the great waves that the
wind could raise in a short time.</p>

<p>“Let’s put down the curtains,” suggested the
sailor. “We want all the shelter we can get, for
it will be chilly by morning.”</p>

<p>“Do you think we’ll be out here all night?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Likely to. We came a good ways behind
Mr. Whale, and we haven’t gone back very
far.”</p>

<p>With the curtains down, and a couple of
lanterns lighted inside, the <i>Dartaway’s</i> interior was
a cosy enough place. Bob insisted on getting another
meal, in spite of the fact that one had been
served not so long ago.</p>

<p>“That wasn’t a regular supper,” he declared.
“This is,” and he started the gasolene stove.</p>

<p>“We must set a watch,” said Sam. “Have
to take turns steering. There are four of us, and
we’d better make it in two shifts. Jerry and I
will take the first one.”</p>

<p>Ned and Bob declared they didn’t feel like taking
the time to sleep before their watch was called,
as the novelty of the night at sea was too much
for them. So they reclined on the bunks, talking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
while Sam went to the wheel, and Jerry
looked after the engine.</p>

<p>A little wind had sprung up and the sea was
heaving more than at any time since the strange
cruise began. Still the <i>Dartaway</i> was not in
trouble. She slid over the waves like a duck, and
made good time, though it was guess work steering
her.</p>

<p>They had been cruising in the teeth of the
wind for about an hour, and Ned and Bob were
beginning to get a little sleep, in spite of their
desire to remain awake, when there came a curious
sound from the engine.</p>

<p>It was a combined cough, wheeze and squeak,
and Jerry who had been leaning back, jumped up
to look at the motor. As he did so it came to a
stop.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble?” called Sam, from the
wheel.</p>

<p>“Motor’s stuck, that’s all. I’ll fix it,” Jerry
replied.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<small>ALMOST RUN DOWN</small></h2>


<p>With vigorous motions Jerry sent the flywheel
spinning around. It went fast enough, but
there was no answering chug-chug. He adjusted
the spark and gasolene levers a few notches forward
and tried again, but without results.</p>

<p>“Maybe the gasolene is out,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“There was plenty a while ago,” answered
Jerry.</p>

<p>Still, he was aware that sometimes a tank will
spring a leak most unexpectedly. He tried the
reservoir, and found there was enough of the
liquid to last a long time. He was sure then the
trouble must be in the motor.</p>

<p>In quick succession Jerry tried all the means
known to him of locating the difficulty. He
knew it must be something slight, as there was
good compression. Then he tried the batteries
and they gave a “fat” green spark. Clearly
there was electricity enough.</p>

<p>“I say,” called back Sam, “got to do something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
pretty soon. We’re losing steerage way,
and we’ll be in the trough in a few minutes.”</p>

<p>With Ned and Bob to help and offer suggestions,
Jerry went all over the engine to locate the
trouble. It might be in one of a dozen places,
for a gasolene motor is a delicate machine and
can get more kinds of things the matter with it
than can a baby.</p>

<p>“How about the carburettor?” asked Bob, referring
to the apparatus where the gasolene is
mixed with air so it will explode in the cylinders.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to monkey with that,” Jerry
replied. “It never has given any trouble, and
I’m afraid to take it apart now.”</p>

<p>Just then the <i>Dartaway</i> gave a violent lurch to
one side, and the boys, who were stooping down,
were nearly thrown off their balance.</p>

<p>“Did we hit something?” called Jerry.</p>

<p>“No, a wave hit us,” Sam replied. “Can’t
you get the engine fixed?”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t seem so.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ve got to do something. She won’t
answer the rudder any more, and is getting down
in the hollows.”</p>

<p>“What can you do?”</p>

<p>“I’ll show you. I haven’t been to sea forty
years for nothing, sonny. I’ll do the same thing I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
did when I was shipwrecked in the Indian Ocean
once, and had to live three days on a raft.”</p>

<p>Sam did not waste any more time in words.
He came from the bow, since it was no longer
any use to try to steer the <i>Dartaway</i>, and made
his way astern. With him he brought the tub in
which the whale line had been coiled.</p>

<p>“The boat isn’t leaking,” said Bob, thinking
the sailor was about to begin bailing operations.</p>

<p>“I know it, you just watch me.”</p>

<p>Sam fastened a piece of rope to each of the
two handles of the tub. These strands he tied
together, and at the place of joining he attached
another rope.</p>

<p>Seeing that all of the knots were secure he
climbed out on the overhanging stern of the boat,
and made the end of the long rope fast to a cleat.
Then he dropped the tub overboard, and it fell
with a splash into the water.</p>

<p>“He’s lost it!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” Sam said. “That’s what
I wanted to do. That’s what we call a drag,
sonny. It will keep the boat head on to the
waves, and that’s the most important thing now.”</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the craft had been pitching
and rolling about in rather an alarming fashion.
The boys had all they could do to stand upright,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
but Sam crawled and walked about like the old
salt that he was.</p>

<p>No sooner had the tub been dropped astern
than an improvement was apparent. The rolling
and pitching ceased, and, though it was still rough
riding compared to being on a lake or river, the
<i>Dartaway</i> stood up well, and was on a more even
keel.</p>

<p>“That drag has something of the same effect as
if we were moving by means of the engine,” explained
Sam. “It keeps the stern in the right
place. The wind on the awning gives us a little
headway and I think we’ll do very well for a
while. Lucky the whale didn’t take the tub with
him.”</p>

<p>Now that they were temporarily in a little better
shape, Jerry renewed his efforts to get the
engine to work. It was anything but an easy
task at best. Even in daylight and on still water
he had often found his ingenuity taxed to the
utmost to discover some slight defect and remedy
it. Now, in a boat that had an uneven motion,
and amid a darkness that the lights seemed to
but increase, it was about as ticklish a proposition
as the youth had ever undertaken.</p>

<p>“I’ll go for’ard,” spoke the sailor. “I can’t
do anything here, and I’ll be on the lookout.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys tried everything they could bring to
mind. They had been in similar trouble before,
though not under such serious circumstances.</p>

<p>“I think after all I’ll have to take the carburettor
out,” Jerry remarked with something like
a sigh, for it was a hard and difficult task.</p>

<p>“I say!” called Sam. “Do you suppose any
of the pipes is stopped up?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Well, we had some trouble once, when I was
aboard the <i>Double Dog Fish</i>, and it was on account
of stopped-up pipes.”</p>

<p>“Was that a motor boat?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Say, that was before we ever thought of
motor boats. It was away back in 1849. It
was this way. There was a barrel of molasses
aboard, and we used to be allowed to help ourselves.
It come in mighty good for sweetening
your tea. Well, one day we opened the spigot
and none come out. First we thought the cook
had shut down on us. Then we thought maybe
the molasses had given out. But it wasn’t either
one.”</p>

<p>“What was it?” asked Jerry, glad of something
to take his mind off the trouble of the
engine.</p>

<p>“Why the spigot was stopped up. One of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
sailors had dropped his ball of rope yarn, with
which he was mending sails, into the barrel one
day, and there it was inside plumb up against the
spigot.”</p>

<p>“How’d you get it out?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“I run my hand down in the barrel, rolling up
my sleeve of course, and got the ball out. Then
the molasses run just the same as before. There
was some kicking though, account of me licking
the molasses off my arm. The men claimed I
got more than my share.”</p>

<p>In spite of their anxiety the boys could not help
laughing at the sailor’s story.</p>

<p>“I thought maybe some pipe or other got
stopped up, and the molasses or whatever it is you
run that engine with, might not be flowing.”</p>

<p>“I never thought of that,” Jerry said. “Wait
until I take a look.”</p>

<p>“How can you look in the gasolene tank?”
came from Bob.</p>

<p>“Well then, feel, if it suits you better.”</p>

<p>Jerry moved forward and was about to remove
the cover from the tank, when a cry from Sam
stopped him.</p>

<p>“Here comes a big steamer!” the sailor yelled.
“It’s bearing right down on us, and we can’t move
out of her course!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“Blow the whistle!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>Instinctively Jerry pulled the cord. He forgot
the engine was not working, and that there was
no compressed air to send out a blast. In the
midst of his terror, he resolved to have a storage
tank installed for air for the whistle if ever they
came safely out of their trouble.</p>

<p>“Ship ahoy!” yelled Sam, with lungs that had
done their duty in all sorts of weather. “On
board the steamer!”</p>

<p>The sailor and Jerry peering between the curtains
at the bow, and Ned and Bob, looking forth
from the side awnings, saw a big vessel bearing
right down on them. They could distinguish the
towering bow and the twinkling lights.</p>

<p>“Ship ahoy! You’ll run us down!” hailed
Sam.</p>

<p>The boys joined their voices to his, and a chorus
of shouts went up. But the wind had freshened
and was blowing quite strongly. Even had the
night been still it is doubtful if the pilot could
have heard, shut up in the bridge house.</p>

<p>As for the lookout aloft, he was too far up,
and the wind, doubtless, made such a noise
through the rigging that it would have taken a
megaphone to have aroused him.</p>

<p>“Veer off! Veer off!” shouted the sailor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>“Can’t they see our lights!” cried Jerry.
“Oh, if only the search light was going!”</p>

<p>“We’re too low down, lad. I’m afraid we’re
done for. If we could only forge ahead a bit!
If the engine was only running!”</p>

<p>It seemed there was no escape. Nearer and
nearer came the big ship. It seemed like a monster
about to crush the little boat in its path.
Once it struck it there would be nothing left of
the <i>Dartaway</i>, and the shock to the steamer
would be so slight those on board would never
notice it.</p>

<p>“If I only had a horn, or something to make a
louder noise with!” said Sam, with something
like a groan.</p>

<p>“A noise!” almost yelled Bob. “Quick,
Jerry! The cannon!”</p>

<p>Jerry made a jump for the brass ordnance.
He seized the string. There was a charge in the
cannon, put there the day after the races. The
boy yanked the lanyard.</p>

<p>Bang!</p>

<p>An explosion roared through the night and
echoed over the dark waters.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<small>NODDY NIXON TURNS UP</small></h2>


<p>Would those on the steamer hear it? Would
they change the course in time? Could they, at
the rate the ship was going?</p>

<p>These were questions which surged through the
minds of those on the <i>Dartaway</i>. How anxiously
they waited to see how they would be answered!</p>

<p>“If she hits us jump for your lives!” cried
Sam, climbing through the awning curtains out on
the gunwale. “It’s the only chance we’ve got!”</p>

<p>But there was some excitement on the steamer.
Lights flashed out on the bow. Then a big glaring
beam from a search lantern cut through the
gloom. There were confused shouts, a jingle of
bells. Evidently the cannon had been heard.</p>

<p>“She’s veering off! She’s veering off!” yelled
the sailor. “Look out for the wash as she passes
us!”</p>

<p>Indeed, the great steamer could be seen to be
changing her course. The immense bow seemed
to glide away from the motor boat. As the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
boys held their breaths the vessel loomed up
almost in front of them, but safely away. They
had just escaped being run down.</p>

<p>With inquiring toots from her big whistles the
steamer surged past the <i>Dartaway</i>. As she glided
by the boys could see, leaning over the rail, a group
of men. Doubtless they wondered what venturesome
mariners these were, out so far at sea in a
little craft.</p>

<p>“Hold hard!” cried Sam.</p>

<p>He spoke only just in time, for the <i>Dartaway</i>
began to rock violently from the wash of the steamer’s
propellors. The boys clung to the awning
stanchions or they might have been flung overboard.</p>

<p>Then, as the steamer, in her changed course,
showed her stern lights to those on the motor boat,
there came a feeling of thanksgiving at their providential
escape from almost certain death.</p>

<p>“Lucky you had that cannon!” commented
Sam. “It was better than a horn or whistle.”</p>

<p>For a few minutes the boys could not reply,
they were so unnerved. But the old sailor seemed
to take it as a matter of course.</p>

<p>“It isn’t the first time I’ve been nearly cut in
two by a steamer,” he said. “That often happens
on the fishing banks.”</p>

<p>Jerry made his way back to the cockpit and sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
down on a bunk. He was trembling from the excitement.</p>

<p>“Brace up!” spoke Sam, noticing the boy’s condition.
“Have another try at the engine. See if
the pipe is stopped up.”</p>

<p>That put Jerry’s mind on another subject, and
relieved him of the strain he was under. He
waited until the commotion of the water had somewhat
subsided, and then went forward again to the
gasolene tank.</p>

<p>Baring his arm to the shoulder, and lying flat
out on the bow, in order to get to the bottom of
the receptacle, he felt around in it. For a few
moments there was an anxious wait. Then he
cried:</p>

<p>“I’ve got it!”</p>

<p>He pulled out a bunch of cotton waste, used to
clean the engine with. How it got in the tank was
a mystery, but it had effectually stopped the flow
of gasolene.</p>

<p>“Now for another try!” exclaimed Bob. “I’ll
bet the <i>Dartaway</i> will prove equal to her name.”</p>

<p>Anxiously the boys went back to the engine.
The fly wheel was spun around. This time there
was an answering chug-chug, and, a moment later
the motor was humming away in a fashion that
thrilled the hearts of all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’re off!” shouted Bob.</p>

<p>“Wait until I get my tub!” exclaimed Sam.
“It’s all I’ve got left of my outfit.”</p>

<p>He scrambled aft, and hauled aboard the improvised
drag. Then Jerry threw in the clutch
and the <i>Dartaway</i> shot ahead.</p>

<p>“Which way shall I steer?” asked Jerry, who
had gone to the wheel.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re as bad off as ever in that regard,”
the sailor replied. “Wait a minute though. That
steamer was cutting right across our bows. We
ought to keep straight on I guess, to fetch up on
the coast, as the vessel was going down along it.
I think I know where we are.”</p>

<p>For a few minutes the boat went along, riding
more evenly, now that it had better headway. Suddenly
there flashed on it a glaring light. It was
steady for a second, and then turned red. It
flashed the ruby glow twice, and then disappeared.</p>

<p>“What was that?” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“The lighthouse!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“Sure enough,” came from Sam. “It’s all
right. I know where I am now. Better let me
take the wheel.”</p>

<p>With the sureness of one who knows his way,
even in the darkest night, the old sailor turned the
craft into the proper channel. Forward it went,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
like a frightened hare scudding back to the shelter
of the burrow.</p>

<p>“Rocky Point Light;&mdash;the South Light,” murmured
Salt Water Sam. “I’m right at home now.
We must have been behind the upper headland or
we’d seen it before. It’s all right. We’re on our
way back.”</p>

<p>So it proved. Through the darkness, illuminated
only by the red and green side lamps, the
<i>Dartaway</i> sped, steered by a sure hand. On and
on she went toward the harbor.</p>

<p>The boys did not learn until afterward that they
had been towed nearly twenty miles by the whale.
Had the weather not remained calm they would
have been in dire peril, but fortune favored them,
even in the matter of escaping from the steamer.
Had they been taken straight out to sea they would
have had more trouble, but the big monster, in
his blind rage, had taken a diagonal course up the
coast.</p>

<p>“My, but I am sleepy,” remarked Jerry, stretching
himself.</p>

<p>“So am I,” added Ned.</p>

<p>“You boys better take a nap,” Sam said. “I’ll
call you about eight bells and take forty winks myself.
We’ll get in about daylight.” And then
he began to sing:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Oh it’s Ho! for a sailor’s life for me;<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>“You’re quite a poet,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“I didn’t make that up,” replied the sailor.
“It was a feller with two eyes. I was mate and
he was second mate on the <i>Tumbling Turtle</i>.”</p>

<p>The boys felt tired enough to take Sam’s advice.
They covered up with blankets on the bunks in the
little cabin, and, in spite of the excitement of the
day and night, dozed off.</p>

<p>It was daylight when Sam awoke them, and they
were just entering the harbor of Harmon Beach.</p>

<p>“I thought you were going to call us at eight
bells,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Four o’clock in the morning’s no time for boys
to be getting up,” said Sam. “I hated to disturb
you. I’m used to staying up.”</p>

<p>“I must hurry up and let mother know we’re
all right,” said Jerry as the boat swung up to the
dock. “She’ll be worried.”</p>

<p>The boys found a crowd awaiting their return,
though it was but seven o’clock. The rumor of
their disappearance in the hunt for the whale had
spread all through the summer colony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“Salt Water Sam was along,” the sailor remarked
proudly to some of the questioners. “We
knew what we were about.” He did not mention
how near they had come to being run down.</p>

<p>“Did you get the whale?” asked a man of the
sailor, as the boys hurried ashore and ran to the
Hopkins cottage.</p>

<p>“We did and we didn’t,” replied the old salt.</p>

<p>“Well, you killed him, anyway.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“He came ashore, dead, down the beach, a little
while ago.”</p>

<p>“Are you joking?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it. Word to that effect just
came.”</p>

<p>“Whoop!” yelled Sam. “I’ll get my old harpoon
back. I must tell the boys. So I haven’t
forgot how to throw the iron! Whoop! Shiver
my timbers! I’ve killed my last whale! Hold me
down, somebody!”</p>

<p>Salt Water Sam was dancing about in great excitement.</p>

<p>“Where’s the whale?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“About three miles south, on the beach.”</p>

<p>“I’m going right down and see it. I must get
the boys. This’ll be great news for them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>Sam made the boat fast to the dock and hurried
to the cottage where the chums had gone. They
had just succeeded in telling Mrs. Hopkins all
about their trip. She had been somewhat worried,
but she felt that Jerry and his companions could
take care of themselves. They had been away too
many nights before, and had gone through too
many adventures, for her to do much worrying, unless
she had good cause.</p>

<p>“Good news, boys!” cried Sam, coming in unannounced.</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“We’ve got our whale! Come on!” He
rapidly explained.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hopkins wanted them to at least stay for
breakfast, but they would not hear of it.</p>

<p>“I’m going to lay claim to the creature,” the
sailor exclaimed. “It has my harpoon in it. That
proves property. Can’t lose any time.”</p>

<p>The boys hurried back to the dock and got into
the boat, and started down the coast. As they
neared a little cove, on which was located another
summer colony, they could see a big crowd collected.</p>

<p>“That’s where it is,” Sam remarked. “Put in
there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>When they landed they saw a big shapeless body
stranded on the beach. It resembled an immense
log of black wood.</p>

<p>“There’s my whale!” cried Sam, proudly.</p>

<p>The creature looked vastly different from the
monster that had towed the boys in their boat out
to sea. They went closer to the crowd, which surrounded
the bulk of flesh and bone. As they made
their way through the fringe of people they heard
some one saying:</p>

<p>“Now you’ve all got to get away. This is my
whale. I discovered it. I’m going to put a tent
over it and charge twenty-five cents admission.
Stand back, I say!”</p>

<p>Something about the tones struck the boys as
being familiar. They went closer.</p>

<p>“Here, no more can come here!” exclaimed a
youth, who began shoving the motor boys back.
“This is my whale.”</p>

<p>There, confronting our three heroes, was Noddy
Nixon.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<small>A BATH HOUSE MYSTERY</small></h2>


<p>For a few seconds it would have been hard to
tell who was the more surprised, Noddy or the
three boys. They stood confronting each other,
while the crowd surged this way and that. Then
Noddy spoke again:</p>

<p>“I want to know what you fellows mean, coming
here trying to take my whale?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Your whale, Noddy Nixon?” inquired Jerry.</p>

<p>“Yes, my whale. Didn’t I discover it ashore
early this morning? I put a paper with my name
on it. I claim it under the law.”</p>

<p>Salt Water Sam thrust himself forward. His
one eye gleamed with an angry light.</p>

<p>“Who’s this young whipper-snapper that claims
my whale?” he asked. “Let me get at him!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you touch me!” cried Noddy, as the
sailor confronted him. “I’ll have you arrested if
you put your hands on me; that’s what I will!”</p>

<p>“I’ll not touch you unless there’s an occasion for
it. How did you get this whale?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>“I was walking along the beach, and I saw it
come in. I ran out and put my card on it. I got
my feet wet, too, and I’m going to get paid for all
my trouble. Now all you people get away. I’m
going to have a tent put up, and charge admission.”</p>

<p>The crowd gathered closer about the boys, the
sailor, Noddy and the whale. The big creature
lay in a little hollow scooped in the sand by the
action of the waves. It had been stranded at high
tide.</p>

<p>“If I thought you knew better I’d spank you,
sonny,” spoke Sam, in quiet but determined tones.
“I guess you’d better run along home to your
mother now.”</p>

<p>This made Noddy furious. He drew back his
hand as though to strike the sailor. The latter,
however, only laughed. He thrust the angry
youth to one side, and, striding to the whale,
placed his hand on the harpoon handle and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Friends, this is the whale I and the three boys
here killed yesterday. We made fast to him, and
he towed us quite a ways out, before we had to cut
loose. My harpoon killed the whale and it’s
mine. There’s my initials on the handle, and
there’s the notches to show how many other creatures
my iron has gone into.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s all the trouble?” asked a tall, bronzed
man, pushing his way into the crowd.</p>

<p>“Hello, Captain Trembly!” cried Sam, recognizing
the master of a near-by life saving station.
“Here’s a whale of mine that’s come ashore, and
this young man lays claim to it because he saw it
first.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” spoke the captain. “It’s your
property, of course, Sam. Only I wouldn’t advise
you to let it stay here very long. This isn’t
good keeping weather for dead whales.”</p>

<p>“Couple of days will do me,” the sailor said
with a laugh. “There, now, sonny,” turning to
Noddy. “Maybe you’ll believe the captain.”</p>

<p>Seeing that the game had gone against him,
Noddy made his way out of the crowd without
speaking. But the looks he cast at the sailor and
the three chums were anything but kind.</p>

<p>“Wonder how he got here?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Seems as if he followed us,” spoke Ned.</p>

<p>They learned afterward that Noddy’s father
had, at his son’s urging, taken a cottage at Glen
Cove, the next summer resort on the coast below
Harmon Beach.</p>

<p>“Now, friends,” went on Sam to the crowd,
“you’re welcome to look at this whale as long as
you like, until I get a tent over it. Then it’ll be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
ten cents to see it. Part of the money I’m going
to give to the hospital here.”</p>

<p>Sam’s spirit, so different from Noddy’s mean
and selfish one, met with quick response on the
part of the assemblage.</p>

<p>“We’ll all come and see it when you’ve got it
under a tent,” one man called out, and there was
a chorus of assents.</p>

<p>Sam got some sailor friends to help him, and
with a couple of horses, hauled the whale higher up
on the beach. Then he put a tent over the big
creature and did a thriving business, exhibiting the
monster. The three chums assisted him, and
acted as lecturers to the curious, telling over and
over again their part in the capture and harpooning.</p>

<p>As for the sailor, he was in his glory. He related
the incidents of the chase with great minuteness,
not omitting the one about the steamer. He
even sold small slivers from the handle of his harpoon.</p>

<p>“Sure I can easy make another handle,” he
confided to the boys, “but it’s not every day I can
sell a bit of wood for twenty-five cents. I must
make money while the whale lasts.”</p>

<p>It only lasted three days, however, and the final
one the patronage visibly fell off. Even the boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
did not seem very keen about going to the tent.</p>

<p>“If it was ambergris in that whale, it would be
all right,” Jerry remarked, as he held a perfumed
handkerchief to his nose. “But it isn’t and that’s
the fault of it.”</p>

<p>The others agreed with him, and that night a
gang of men dug a big hole in the beach and tumbled
the whale into it. But Sam made a goodly
sum, which he wanted to share with the boys. They
would take none of his money, however, so the
sailor made a liberal donation to charity.</p>

<p>“Seen anything more of Noddy?” asked Jerry
of his chums one morning, when they were out in
their boat, cruising about the harbor.</p>

<p>“No, and I don’t want to,” replied Bob.
“Noddy wouldn’t be so bad, if we could know
when he’s coming so as to avoid him, but combined
with Bill Berry the two are the limit.”</p>

<p>“That reminds me of something,” put in Ned.
“I heard Bill Berry had a job down here somewhere.”</p>

<p>“How’d you hear it?” Jerry asked.</p>

<p>“Got a letter from Andy Rush. He said he
was talking with old Pete Bumps, and Pete told
him Bill had a job at some lighthouse along the
coast. Andy said he thought it was in this neighborhood,
and he went on to say that Pete wanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
us to try and get him a job also. Andy suggested
perhaps Pete thought the work was as easy as the
name suggested. Andy says he may come down
for a week or so a little later.”</p>

<p>“Queer Andy, with his rapid-fire talk,” remarked
Ned. “I’d like to see him. Wonder if
it’s true about Bill? He might be at the lighthouse
we saw the other night.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to find out,” spoke Jerry. “Now
let’s talk about something pleasant. What do
you say to running ashore and having a bath?
There’s a nice place just ahead.”</p>

<p>The boys voted it would be a good plan, and
the boat was steered for the beach, where there
were a number of bathing pavilions. The <i>Dartaway</i>
was made fast to a dock and soon the boys
were putting on suits which they hired.</p>

<p>They remained in the water about an hour, enjoying
the gentle surf, and floating lazily beyond
the line of breakers.</p>

<p>“This is something like life,” remarked Bob,
as he let the waves carry him toward shore.</p>

<p>“Surprised you’re satisfied without a sandwich
while you’re floating,” came from Jerry.</p>

<p>With a rapid motion of his hand, Bob splashed
a small wave into Jerry’s face, causing him to
cough and splutter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s enough!” cried the joker. “I’ll
quit.”</p>

<p>“Speaking of sandwiches reminds me it’s nearly
dinner time,” remarked Ned. “I’m going
ashore.”</p>

<p>The others followed his example, and were soon
in the booths, dressing. Jerry had nearly completed
his toilet, when he heard quite a commotion
in the compartment next to him. He knew it
could not be caused by Ned or Bob, as they were
farther down the line. Some one was pounding
on the thin wooden walls and shouting:</p>

<p>“Help! Help! I’ve been robbed!”</p>

<p>“What is it?” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“Some one has taken my diamond ring!” was
the reply, and, as Jerry peered from the door of
his room, he saw a man, partly dressed, rush from
the one next him, crying at the top of his voice:</p>

<p>“I’ve been robbed! I’ve been robbed!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>LOOKING FOR BILL</small></h2>


<p>Jerry turned toward the rear wall of his compartment
to get his necktie, which was hanging on
a nail. As he did so he happened to glance out of
the crescent shaped ventilating opening at the rear
and saw a man running over the sand, looking back
every now and then.</p>

<p>Something about the figure seemed strangely
familiar to Jerry, though as he could not get a
front view, he was puzzled for a moment.</p>

<p>“I know him! It’s Bill Berry!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Without pausing to adjust his collar and tie,
Jerry ran out. He was joined by his chums, and
several men who had been alarmed by the cries.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked half a dozen.</p>

<p>“I’ve been robbed! My diamond ring, worth
five hundred dollars, is missing!” shouted the
half-dressed man.</p>

<p>“Where did you leave it?” asked an attendant.</p>

<p>“I hid it in my shoe.”</p>

<p>“You should have left it at the office. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
management can not be responsible for jewelry
taken from the bath houses.”</p>

<p>“They can’t, eh? Well, we’ll see about that!”
spluttered the excited man. “I’ve been robbed
and some one has got to settle with me for it.”</p>

<p>Jerry came close to the man who was raising
such a disturbance and gave a start.</p>

<p>“Why, Professor Snodgrass!” he ejaculated.
“Is it really you?”</p>

<p>“Jerry Hopkins!” cried the man and shook
hands. “I am delighted to meet you!” And
Uriah Snodgrass beamed on the boy. “How
came you here? Do you think I can find any
valuable bugs or butterflies in this neighborhood?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know about butterflies and bugs,”
answered Jerry, with a grin, for he well remembered
the failings of the old collector, who had accompanied
the motor boys on their trip to
Mexico and across the plains. “But what is this
about your diamond ring?”</p>

<p>“Somebody has stolen it. And what is more,
they have taken something even more valuable&mdash;a
case full of choice specimens of mosquitoes!”
And Uriah Snodgrass shook his head in despair.</p>

<p>“Mosquitoes!” snorted an attendant, in disgust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah! a rare collection, worth a thousand dollars
or more!”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t give you ten cents for a bushel of
mosquitoes.”</p>

<p>“Well, I want them back&mdash;and I want my
diamond ring,” said the professor.</p>

<p>“How did it happen?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“I don’t know exactly. I had been in the water
about an hour. When I came out I dressed, and
when I came to put my shoes on, before I put on
my coat, vest and collar, I happened to think I
had left my ring in the toe of my left shoe. I
looked for it, and it was gone.”</p>

<p>“Was your door forced?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t appear to be.”</p>

<p>“Let’s have a look at your room,” suggested
the attendant, and he led the way to it, followed
by a throng.</p>

<p>There was no evidence that the door had been
tampered with. The lock was not sprung, and
there were no marks on the jamb, which would
have been the case had the door been forced open
with a jimmy.</p>

<p>While Uriah Snodgrass, the attendant, and
those gathered out of curiosity were standing outside
the bath house, Jerry went inside. As he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
stepped on the floor he noticed that one of
the boards was loose. He stooped down, and
found he could lift the plank up.</p>

<p>“There’s how the thief got in!” he exclaimed.
“See there is a space beneath the floor, and a man
could crawl under from in back.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, these houses set on piles driven into
the sand,” the attendant stated. “There’s a space
of about two feet between the floor and the
beach.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll sue the management!” declared the
professor. “The idea of leaving things so a
burglar could push up a board, reach his hand in,
and take whatever he wanted!”</p>

<p>“You should have left your ring at the office,”
insisted the man who looked after the pavilions.
“What sort of a ring was it?”</p>

<p>“It was a big diamond set in the head of a
snake with two rubies for eyes,” Professor Snodgrass
replied. “It’s all right enough to talk about
leaving it at the office. Lock the stable door
after the horse is stolen is a good motto, also, but
it doesn’t give me back my ring. I’ll sue some
one.”</p>

<p>While the professor was muttering to himself,
and finishing dressing, Jerry motioned to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
chums who had come up to speak to Uriah Snodgrass,
to follow him. He led them a safe distance
away and said:</p>

<p>“Guess who I saw.”</p>

<p>“Noddy Nixon!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“Bill Berry,” replied Jerry, and he told what
he had observed.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose he was running away
for?” asked Bob. “Are you sure it was Bill?”</p>

<p>“Positive. As to what he was doing I believe
he stole that ring.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go tell the professor,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t do any good,” came from Jerry.
“We haven’t any proof, and we might get unpleasantly
mixed up in the thing.”</p>

<p>“What would you suggest?”</p>

<p>“What do you say to trying to locate Bill?”
Jerry went on. “If he’s working at a lighthouse
near here we can easily find him. There are not
so many. There’s one up the coast about five
miles, and one down from here, about the same
distance. We can take a couple of days at it
cruising around, and combine business with pleasure,
though it’s not very nice business hunting for
Bill. What do you say?”</p>

<p>“Fine!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>“It will be a regular picnic!” from Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh, of course it will if Chunky goes along,”
put in Ned. “Always thinking of something to
eat. Don’t take the compass for a can of peas
next time!”</p>

<p>Bob aimed a blow at his tormentor, but Ned
cleverly dodged it.</p>

<p>“Let him alone,” suggested Jerry. “He was
punished enough. Well, if you’re agreed, let’s
get ready to make the trip. We can start to-morrow.”</p>

<p>The boys talked the robbery over with Uriah
Snodgrass in a general way but did not mention
Bill Berry, not wishing to excite the professor too
much. They learned that their old friend was
only down to the shore for the day and must go
back to the city to deliver a lecture at eight o’clock
that evening.</p>

<p>“I shall sue somebody,” said Uriah Snodgrass,
“if I don’t get my ring and my box of mosquitoes
back.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they will turn up some day,”
answered Bob; and then the motor boys and Uriah
Snodgrass separated.</p>

<p>The boys spent the afternoon cleaning the engine
and getting the boat in shape for the proposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
trip. They made sure they had a compass along
this time, and Bob was only allowed to supervise
what was strictly eatable.</p>

<p>“Shall we try the upper or the lower lighthouse?”
asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“The upper one,” suggested Bob. “We’ve
seen the lower one, at least the light of it from a
distance, but never the upper.”</p>

<p>So it was arranged. Early the next morning
the boys were at the dock. As they unlocked the
boathouse they heard a voice singing, as the
owner trudged along the beach:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“It was on the isle of Nankum,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Near the land of Timbuctoo<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That poor old Sam fell overboard one night.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">There was a great commotion<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In the middle of the ocean,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Sure he gave the sharks and whales a terrible fright.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“Salt Water Sam!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“Avast and belay my hearties!” shouted the
sailor, who was nothing if not good natured.
“Whither away this bright, beautiful morning?”</p>

<p>“Up the coast,” replied Jerry. “We’re going
to take a look at the other lighthouse.”</p>

<p>“Just the thing!” cried Sam. “I know
lighthouses like I do the sea. It’s part of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
business. I’ll go along, and we’ll combine business
with pleasure.”</p>

<p>“How’s that, by catching another whale and
exhibiting it?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“It’ll be sharks this time,” the sailor went on.
“Wait till I get my tackle and I’ll be with you.”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t wait to be asked,” commented
Jerry with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Oh, let him come along,” put in Ned. “He’s
good fun, and he helped us a lot. Besides, he
may know the lighthouse keeper.”</p>

<p>“And it will be sport to fish for sharks,” added
Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh I’m willing,” came from Jerry.</p>

<p>Sam soon returned from the shack where he
lived with two good sized hooks, some short
lengths of chain, and a coil of thin rope. He
also carried some salt pork in a paper.</p>

<p>“If we land a couple of big ones we can take
in almost as much as we did on the whale,” he
added. “Course the sharks around here aren’t
the great big fellows, but eight feet is no slouch
of a fish, and I’ve seen plenty that size.”</p>

<p>They started off, sailing across the harbor
toward the mouth, and, passing through the narrow
strait, laid their course up the coast. The sea
was calm, and the day a fine one for a sail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“How do you fish for sharks?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Just bait the hook and throw it overboard,”
replied Sam. “But we’ll wait until we’re on our
way back. Don’t want to tow a shark up to the
lighthouse.”</p>

<p>About two hours’ run brought the boat in sight
of the upper point, on which the warning beacon
was built. It stood in bold relief against the sky,
a tall white object, like a big round chimney.</p>

<p>“Will they let us go in it?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Sure, I know the keeper,” replied Sam.
“He’s an old friend of mine.”</p>

<p>There was a little dock near the foot of the
lighthouse and to this the boat was made fast. As
the boys scrambled up the rocks that led to a little
level plateau on which the house was built,
they kept their eyes open for a sight of Bill Berry.</p>

<p>The only person they saw, however, was a little
girl. She had light flaxen hair which streamed all
about her head in the stiff wind that was blowing.</p>

<p>“Hello lassie; is your papa in?” asked Sam.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, he’s filling the lamps.”</p>

<p>“Tell him Robinson Crusoe and his three men,
Friday, Saturday and Sunday would like to see
him.”</p>

<p>“Are you really and truly Robinson Crusoe?”
demanded the child, her eyes big with wonder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well I was shipwrecked often enough to be,”
was Sam’s answer, as he smiled. “Jack Stilkins
will know who’s here when he gets that message,”
he added, and the little girl went into the lower
part of the lighthouse.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br />
<small>LANDING A SHARK</small></h2>


<p>“Hello, Sam! Up to some of your jokes
again, eh?” asked a hearty voice, and a short,
stout man, with blue eyes, which contrasted
strangely with the bronze of his face, came from
the tower. “I knew it must be you, when the
lassie came in, all excited, at having seen Robinson.
How are you? Where you going? Who
are the lads with you? How’ve you been?”</p>

<p>“I’ll give you my log book and let you take a
look at it if that’s the way you’re going to go at
me,” answered Sam. “The fact of the matter is
the boys, here, want to see a lighthouse. They’re
landlubbers, you know.”</p>

<p>There was no use of resenting the way in which
Sam spoke. He meant no offense, and the boys,
realizing his character, took none.</p>

<p>“Landlubbers, eh?” commented Mr. Stilkins.
“Well, it’s too bad, but I s’pose it’s not their
fault.”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Sam gravely, as though it was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
very important matter. “They was born so,”
and then the two men had a hearty laugh, in which
the boys joined.</p>

<p>“Well, I can show you the lighthouse, but
there isn’t much to see,” the keeper went on. “We
just keep the light going at night. That’s all
there is to it. This is a flashing light. That is,
it shows two red flashes at intervals of ten seconds
each.”</p>

<p>“The one below has a white flash and two red
ones,” commented Jerry.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s the difference, and it’s a big one
for sailors. You see it’s safe to come in right
close to shore here. In fact that’s the only channel.
If they stand too far out they’ll fetch up
on the rocks or a sand bar. But they’ve got to
do just the opposite in regard to the other light.
They must keep at least two miles out, or they’ll
get spitted on the rocks. So you see when they
observe two red flashes only they know it’s time to
stand in, and when they see a white flash and two
red ones, it’s time to stay out. Easy, when you
once know how; eh, Sam,” and the keeper clapped
the sailor on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“That’s what, messmate. Can you show the
boys the machinery?”</p>

<p>The three chums were much interested in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
mechanism that revolved the lenses of the light,
at the top of the tower.</p>

<p>“Do you have any help?” asked Jerry, thinking
of the object of their trip.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I’ve got a man who shares the trick
with me.”</p>

<p>“Same one you had?” asked Sam, saving Jerry
the trouble of putting a question.</p>

<p>“No, this is a new feller came the other day.”</p>

<p>Jerry hardly looked at the other boys. He
felt he was on the right track.</p>

<p>“Who is he?” Sam went on.</p>

<p>“Name’s Bill&mdash;Bill&mdash;pshaw! I’ve clean
forgotten it.”</p>

<p>Jerry felt the keeper must notice his confusion.</p>

<p>“There he is now,” went on Mr. Stilkins, pointing
to a man coming toward the lighthouse.
Jerry and his chums turned expecting to see Bill
Berry confronting them. The shock, when they
saw that the keeper’s assistant was a little fat man,
about as broad as he was tall, and crosseyed; (as
different as possible from Bill Berry), almost
made Jerry gasp.</p>

<p>“Hi, Bill!” called the keeper. “What’s your
last name?”</p>

<p>“Smith,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Must have been a terrible strain on your mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
to remember that,” commented Sam. “Well,
have you boys seen enough?”</p>

<p>The chums felt that they had, considering that
the man they sought was not at this lighthouse.
They silently made up their minds they would have
to try the next one.</p>

<p>As the little party boarded the <i>Dartaway</i> the
keeper called them an invitation to come and see
him at any time. He promised to show them the
light when it was in operation, and the boys resolved
to take advantage of the offer.</p>

<p>“Now for a little try at the sharks,” spoke
Sam, as the boat got underway and swung out into
the channel. “I think we’ll stand out a bit.”</p>

<p>“We might run on the rocks, they’re out a
ways,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Not with what this craft draws,” replied the
sailor. “You haven’t got over three feet, and
the rocks are a fathom below the surface at low
tide.”</p>

<p>Sam prepared his shark lines. He had two of
them, each one with six feet of chain nearest the
hook, for the big fish would bite through the
hempen strands in an instant. The hooks were
of good size, and Sam baited each one with a bit
of the fat salt pork. Then he fastened the lines
to the stern of the boat, and taking up his position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
where he could feel to see if there was a bite, he
tossed the bait overboard.</p>

<p>“Send her slow and easy,” he said to Ned, who
was at the wheel. “We’ll soon be on their feeding
ground.”</p>

<p>With the motor running on first speed the boat,
which had been put some distance out from shore,
went down along the coast. It was a calm day,
and so clear that objects could be seen for a long
distance.</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked Jerry in a low voice to his
two chums, who were in the bow, “we didn’t land
him that time.”</p>

<p>“Got to try the next lighthouse,” said Bob.
“What are we going to do when we find Bill?”</p>

<p>That was a phase of the question that had not
occurred to any of them up to this point.</p>

<p>“Make him give up the ring,” suggested Ned.</p>

<p>“We’d better go slow, where Bill Berry is concerned,”
Bob said. “I think it would be better to
tell the professor what we know.”</p>

<p>“Let’s find Bill first,” counseled Jerry. “Be
careful not to let any one know we’re looking for
him.”</p>

<p>Sam, who had been sitting quietly in the stern,
with his hands resting lightly on the lines, suddenly
jumped up and began pulling on one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did you hook him?” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“He got away,” the sailor said in a disgusted
tone. “He was only nibbling at the bait. But
we’re amongst ’em now. Be on the watch.”</p>

<p>Jerry and Bob went back to join Sam, while Ned
stayed to run the engine and steer. But the first
bite was not at once followed by any others. The
boat went along for a mile or more before Sam
gave any evidence of feeling the hooks touched.
Then he uttered a yell:</p>

<p>“I’ve got one now!”</p>

<p>He began to haul in on the line, calling to the
two boys to help him. The lads yanked with all
their strength, as did the sailor, but they had met
their match. Something at the other end of the
line was pulling against them, and they could not
budge it.</p>

<p>“Speed up the boat a bit!” called Sam.
“We’ll tire him out and try again!”</p>

<p>Ned put the motor to second speed, and the
craft churned through the water. Sam waited a
few minutes and then tried the line again, the boys
helping him.</p>

<p>“He’s a little easier now,” the sailor remarked.
“That pulling on his jaw weakened him.”</p>

<p>In fact they were able to get in some slack now.
They pulled and pulled, until it seemed that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
must have gotten up enough line to reach to the
bottom of the ocean. Still nothing showed. But
there was always that dead weight at the end of
the small cable.</p>

<p>“Look out for trouble when he gets near the
surface,” panted Sam. “Ned, can’t you lash the
wheel and come back here with the hatchet?
We’ll need you.”</p>

<p>Ned fastened the wheel so as to keep the boat
in a straight course, and, wondering what part he
was going to play, picked up a long-handled
hatchet Sam had brought along and went to the
stern.</p>

<p>His chums and the sailor were still hauling on
the line, their hands and arms aching from the
strain. Foot after foot was pulled aboard until
Sam exclaimed:</p>

<p>“We’ll have him up in a few seconds!”</p>

<p>Hardly had he spoken when there was a commotion
near the surface of the ocean, about ten
feet from the stern of the boat. The water was
lashed into foam, and in the midst of the swirling
eddies could be seen the tip of a big tail, and the
triangular shaped, dorsal fin of the shark.</p>

<p>“There he is!” yelled Sam. “He’s a big
one!”</p>

<p>It seemed as though they had hooked on to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
small whirlwind beneath the water, or a miniature
torpedo that was in full flight around in a circle.
The big fish, in its efforts to get rid of the hook,
and escape that relentless pulling, was fighting with
all its savage strength. With fins and tail it
sought to get away.</p>

<p>“Pull! Pull!” cried Sam. “Ned, stand
ready with the hatchet, and clip him on the head
when you get a show!”</p>

<p>Closer and closer to the boat they pulled the
shark. They could almost grasp the chain part
of the line now. Then, above the water, was
thrust the ugly head of the fish. While it was
not a man-eater, or as large as the shark of the
tropical seas, being in fact only an immense dog
fish, the creature was so ugly and horrible, with
its under-shot mouth, and unblinking eyes, that
Jerry and Bob were almost inclined to let go.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” cautioned Sam, taking a turn of
the rope about a cleat.</p>

<p>Then the fish lashed out more furiously than
ever with its tail. The water was white with
foam. The big jaws snapped ominously close to
the boat. The craft rocked and pitched with the
violence of the fish’s efforts.</p>

<p>“Quick, Ned, or he’ll upset us!” called Sam.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />
<small>THE ABANDONED VESSEL</small></h2>


<p>“I can’t reach him!” cried Ned, leaning as
far over as he could, hatchet in hand.</p>

<p>“Have to pull him closer,” panted Sam. “Altogether
now, boys!”</p>

<p>The three grasped the chain and hauled.
Nearer and nearer, came the fighting shark. The
jaws never ceased snapping in an endeavor to bite
through the chain.</p>

<p>“Quick, Ned!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>Ned raised the keen little axe. Resting one
hand on the gunwale he leaned forward, and, with
all his strength sent the blade into the head of the
big fish. It was buried almost to the handle.</p>

<p>There was one wild, convulsive lashing of the
tail, one final tremendous effort on the part of the
shark to break away. Then, with a quiver, which
almost shook loose the hold of Sam and the boys,
the big fish was helpless.</p>

<p>“There!” remarked the sailor, with a sigh of
relief, “that was a fine catch, and a bigger one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
than I counted on. He put up a good fight.”</p>

<p>“How big is he?” asked Jerry, as he wrapped
his handkerchief around his hand where the rope
had cut it.</p>

<p>“Seven feet if he’s an inch,” replied Sam.
“Folks’ll pay money to see him.”</p>

<p>“Looks as if some were coming now,” put in
Bob.</p>

<p>They all glanced toward shore, as they were now
opposite Harmon Beach, and from the summer
resort a number of boats were putting off, headed
for the <i>Dartaway</i>.</p>

<p>“Wonder what’s up?” said Jerry.</p>

<p>Sam was engaged in putting a line about the
shark’s tail, by means of a boat hook, in order to
secure his prize, as the barb might pull from the
jaw. On his direction the boys also put a cable
about the fish’s gills, and the two lines were fastened
to a cleat at the stern of the craft.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll head for shore,” said the sailor.</p>

<p>By this time several motor boats were within
hailing distance of the boys’ craft.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? Are you sinking? Do
you want any help?” were some of the cries.</p>

<p>“No, we’re just shark-hunting,” replied Jerry.</p>

<p>“It looked, from shore, as though you were trying
to keep the boat from sinking,” said a young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
fellow in the nearest craft. “There was a general
alarm, and we all started out for you.”</p>

<p>“Much obliged,” Jerry replied. “But we’re
all right.”</p>

<p>The other boats crowded around, the occupants
looking in wonder at the big fish, which was being
towed close to the surface. The shark was taken
safely ashore and Sam, showing his prize under
canvas, reaped another harvest, only not so large
as in the case of the whale.</p>

<p>“What will you boys do next?” asked Mrs.
Hopkins with something like despair in her tones,
when she heard of the latest adventure of her son
and his chums. “Jerry, I’m afraid to have you
go out in that boat.”</p>

<p>“Why, there’s no danger, mother. We can all
swim.”</p>

<p>“But suppose a shark, like the one you caught,
should come after you?”</p>

<p>“Those aren’t the kind that eat people,” put in
Ned, anxious to reassure Mrs. Hopkins.</p>

<p>“I’ll never go bathing again unless it’s in the
tank,” said the widow. “I’ll always be thinking
of sharks.”</p>

<p>“We haven’t begun to exhaust the possibilities
of this place,” put in Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now do be careful, please,” begged Mrs.
Hopkins, and the boys promised faithfully.</p>

<p>The boys remembered this promise about three
days. In that time they turned down a request of
Sam’s that they go off on another shark-hunting
expedition, and also one to take a long cruise to
the southern part of the coast after another whale,
he said he had heard was sighted.</p>

<p>“We’d like to help you, Sam,” said Jerry.
“But it’s too much risk.”</p>

<p>“Well I’ll bet you boys will take bigger ones
when I’m not with you,” the sailor said. “Never
mind, I’ve made more money this summer than I
ever did in a season before, thanks to you. Any
time you want Sam’s help, just come to him,” and
he strolled off singing:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I caught a shark, I caught a whale,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I caught a lobster by the tail.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I caught a skate, I caught its mate,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">All hands on deck and don’t be late!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“It’s about time we made a trip to the other
lighthouse to see if we can spot Bill Berry,” remarked
Ned one afternoon.</p>

<p>“Shall we ask Sam to go along?” came from
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Well, he seems to know the ropes, and he’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
lots of fun. Besides we sort of turned him down
the last time he asked us to go out.”</p>

<p>It was agreed that they would take the old
sailor, but when they sought him they learned he
had gone off for a couple of days on a fishing trip.
They decided they would await his return. In
the meanwhile they made short trips up and down
the beach, going ashore to have lunch, which was
served from the boat’s pantry. Mrs. Hopkins
was a guest on one or two occasions.</p>

<p>One morning the boys were awakened at the
cottage by a loud pounding at the kitchen door.
None of the servants was up and Jerry, poking his
head from his bed room window, which overlooked
the rear entrance, called out:</p>

<p>“Who’s there?”</p>

<p>“It’s me! Sam! Hurry up boys!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? Is the place on fire?”</p>

<p>“No, but there’s a big vessel gone on the reef
down the coast.”</p>

<p>“A wreck?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and she’s abandoned.”</p>

<p>“Anybody killed?”</p>

<p>“No, the life-savers got every one off. But
there’s a chance to pick up some cargo, and make
money. She’s pounding to pieces fast. Hurry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
’fore the other boats get ahead of us. All hands
on deck!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” inquired Mrs. Hopkins,
who was awakened by Sam’s excited voice.</p>

<p>“Oh, he wants us to go out and see a wreck,”
spoke her son.</p>

<p>“Now, Jerry, be careful.”</p>

<p>“I will, mother. There’s no danger. Hi!
Ned and Bob! Going to sleep all day?”</p>

<p>His chums got up in a hurry at the hail and,
while they were dressing, Jerry told them what
Sam had said.</p>

<p>“He’s always around when there’s a chance to
make money,” commented Ned.</p>

<p>“It’ll be worth while to see a wreck,” Bob remarked.
“I’m glad the crew and passengers were
saved.”</p>

<p>The boys made a hurried breakfast and then
went down to the dock where the <i>Dartaway</i> was
tied. They found Sam before them, getting
things ready for the trip. He had a number of
boat-hooks and several coils of rope.</p>

<p>“Might as well go at this thing scientific,” he
said. “We ought to be able to pick up a good
bit of the floating cargo.”</p>

<p>“How did it happen?” asked Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>“Made a mistake in the lights, I hear,” the
sailor replied. “Thought they were further up
the coast. It was thick last night, and they went
on the reef. Valuable cargo, too, and they threw
a lot overboard, trying to lighten the ship, before
they found it was hopeless.”</p>

<p>In a little while the <i>Dartaway</i> was speeding out
of the harbor, and down the coast toward the
wrecked vessel. The haze of the night before
had lifted and the air was clear. The sea was
calm, though Sam seemed a little surprised as he
glanced at the barometer.</p>

<p>“She’s falling,” he muttered.</p>

<p>“What does that mean?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, it generally indicates a storm,” the
sailor replied. “But I guess we’ll be back long
before it comes. There’s no sign of it now.”</p>

<p>The boat was speeding along at good speed.
The coast line opened up as they forged ahead,
and soon they had a good view of a broad expanse
of water.</p>

<p>“There she is!” cried Sam, pointing ahead.</p>

<p>“What?” inquired the boys all at once.</p>

<p>“The wreck.”</p>

<p>“I can’t see anything,” objected Ned.</p>

<p>“See that little black speck, just below where
that gull is hovering?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“That’s it.”</p>

<p>“Must be quite a way out,” commented Jerry.</p>

<p>“Seven miles,” the sailor replied. “But
that’s nothing. The whale took us farther.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br />
<small>ABOARD THE WRECK</small></h2>


<p>The motor boat made good time, and about an
hour later was almost at the wreck, which, as the
boys could see, was that of quite a good sized
steamer. She had run well up on a rocky reef, and
when the tide fell, the strain had “broken her
back” so that the bow and stern were separated.
The stern was low in the water, and gradually
settling.</p>

<p>“Good thing it’s calm,” Sam remarked, “we
can get close up, and, perhaps go aboard.”</p>

<p>“Will they let us?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“There’s nobody to stop us,” replied the sailor.
“The ship is abandoned. True, we can’t take
anything away, but we can pick up anything we see
floating, and claim salvage on it, and, by the looks
there’s a lot of cargo gone overboard.”</p>

<p>By this time they were quite close to the wreck.
On one side the waves were breaking against the
steamer in a way that made it dangerous to approach.
The motor boat was sent around, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
and Sam saw a place protected enough to
allow the <i>Dartaway</i> to go up close.</p>

<p>It required a nice bit of seamanship to get
aboard, but here was where Sam’s long years of
service served him and the boys in good stead.
They made their boat fast to some dangling ropes,
and soon were on the sloping deck of the after
part of the wrecked steamer.</p>

<p>All about were evidences of the haste with
which the crew and passengers had departed.
On the deck were scattered articles of clothing;
boxes and trunks had been broken open and the
most valuable things taken.</p>

<p>The boys ventured to the edge of the deck,
where it had been almost completely separated
from the forward part. They could look down
through the various holds and into the engine
room.</p>

<p>“Pity to see all this gone to waste,” remarked
Jerry. “Can’t they save any of it?”</p>

<p>“Don’t look so,” replied the sailor. “It’s
about as bad a wreck as I ever saw. They’ll
have hard work lightering the cargo off here.
Maybe it’s well insured.”</p>

<p>It was a new and novel experience for the boys
to be aboard a big wrecked steamer. They went
below, though it was anything but easy, considering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
the condition of the companionways which
were at all angles. They went through the cabins,
into some of the staterooms, and saw many valuable
articles, but Sam advised them not to touch
any.</p>

<p>“I’m not clear on the law,” he said. “I know
it’s all right to pick stuff out of the sea, but it may
be piracy or worse to take it off a vessel so near
shore. We’ll get enough as it is. I see the stuff
is fairly tumbling from the hold in the forward
part of the ship.”</p>

<p>“Hark! What’s that noise?” asked Jerry
suddenly, holding up his hand for silence.</p>

<p>Above the splash of the waves against the side
there sounded a long, drawn-out cry.</p>

<p>“It’s a baby! Some one has forgotten their
baby!” cried Sam. “The life savers took everybody
off, and left the baby behind!”</p>

<p>Once more the cry came. It was a regular wail.</p>

<p>“That’s a cat!” declared Bob.</p>

<p>“I tell you it’s a baby!” the sailor insisted.</p>

<p>This time there came an unmistakable “mew!”</p>

<p>“Where is it?” inquired Jerry.</p>

<p>They listened and the cry was repeated several
times. They finally traced it to an open hatchway,
and, looking down could dimly make out
the form of a cat on some boxes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come on up, pussy,” called Ned.</p>

<p>“Mew! Mew!” cried the feline, as though
asking for help.</p>

<p>“Guess it can’t get out,” Sam said. “Things
are all topsy-turvy down there.”</p>

<p>“Will we have to leave the poor thing here to
drown?” Ned asked. He was very fond of animals.</p>

<p>“I guess not,” the sailor replied. “Salt Water
Sam ain’t that kind. I wish it was a baby though,
I’m terrible fond of babies.”</p>

<p>“How are you going to get it?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you,” and the sailor began looking
about for a means of rescuing the kitten.</p>

<p>He soon found what he wanted. It was a long
rope, and before the boys had fathomed his intention
he rove one end of it through a pulley on the
end of a boom that projected from a mast, and
which had been used to hoist cargo from the hold.</p>

<p>“Now if you boys will lower me down I’ll get
the pussy and you can haul us both up,” Sam said,
as he fastened the rope about his waist. The
chums did as he requested, and soon Sam’s head
disappeared into the depths of the vessel. The
boys could hear him calling:</p>

<p>“Here, pussy! Here, pussy! Sam’ll take care
of you! Must be hungry, poor little kittie!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>They felt the rope slacken, indicating that the
sailor had landed on the pile of boxes. Then it
shook, showing that Sam was after the cat. A
little later they heard him calling:</p>

<p>“Haul away! I’ve got her!”</p>

<p>Just as the boys began to pull on the rope that
was to hoist the sailor from the hold there came a
sudden jar to the wreck. The deck, that was
tilted at a sharp angle, assumed a more decided
one. At the same time there was a grinding,
crashing sound.</p>

<p>“Hurry!” yelled Sam. “She’s breaking up!”</p>

<p>There was a sickening lurch to the after part of
the ship. The boys could hardly keep their feet.</p>

<p>“Pull! Pull!” cried Sam, from the depths of
the hold, where the cargo could be heard shifting
about.</p>

<p>“All together!” sang out Jerry, and the boys
put all their strength to the rope. Sam came up
“on the run” and was landed on deck. He held
the cat in his arms, the frightened creature clinging
closely to him.</p>

<p>“No time to lose, boys!” cried the sailor, as
he loosened the rope from his waist. “She’s
sliding off into deep water. We must leave her!”</p>

<p>They made a rush for the side, climbed over
the bulwarks and slid down the rope into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
<i>Dartaway</i>. The cat still clung to Sam. The
boys could see the wreck moving off the reef
which had hitherto held it in place. It was slipping
into the deep water astern.</p>

<p>“Start the engine!” cried Jerry as he sprang
to the wheel. Ned turned the fly wheel over.
The chug-chug sounded at once, and with a splutter
the boat was off, darting away from the wreck.</p>

<p>“Get well out! Well out!” cried Sam, “or
we’ll be sucked under!”</p>

<p>Jerry speeded up the motor. The boys looked
back. Faster and faster the stern of the wreck
was slipping into the sea. The waters seemed to
be reaching up to swallow it.</p>

<p>Then, with a sound like a great sigh <a href="#image01">half the
steamer disappeared from sight beneath the waves</a>.
There was a boiling and bubbling in the water,
and a giant whirlpool formed. But the <i>Dartaway</i>
was beyond the reach of it. The force of the sucking
currents tossed the small craft about, but Jerry
kept the engine going at full speed, and soon they
were in calmer water.</p>

<p>“That was a narrow squeak,” observed Sam.
“But we saved the cat, anyhow,” and he patted
the animal.</p>

<p>The sea, all about them, was dotted with bales
and boxes from the ships. More were constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
coming to the surface as they were released from
the sunken wreck.</p>

<p>“Better make hay while the sea is calm,” observed
Sam. “There’ll be a lot more boats out
here in a little while, and we want to get our share
of the wreckage.”</p>

<p>Then with the boat-hooks they had brought the
boys and the sailor began pulling in what they
could reach. Some of the boxes seemed to be very
light.</p>

<p>“I wonder if there’s anything in ’em?” Bob
asked.</p>

<p>“They’re labeled,” spoke Ned.</p>

<p>“Cinchona bark,” read Jerry. “Why, that’s
the stuff they make quinine from. This is valuable.”</p>

<p>“I thought we’d make something on this deal,”
said Sam, much pleased. “You stick to Salt
Water Sam and you’ll be rich.”</p>

<p>“It begins to look so,” admitted Ned, with a
laugh.</p>

<p>“Here come some more boats,” called Jerry,
and he pointed to where several power craft, and
some big dories could be seen approaching.</p>

<p>The occupants were bent on the same work as
were the boys, and they picked up all the floating
wreckage they could.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>“Better not overload the craft,” Sam cautioned,
after half an hour’s work.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s calm, and we only have a short run
to shore,” objected Jerry, who wanted to get all
of the valuable bark he could. Some of the boxes
and bales were too heavy to be taken into the <i>Dartaway</i>.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t like the looks of the weather,”
Sam answered. “There’s no immediate danger,
but you never can tell what a gasolene engine will
do. Remember our one experience.”</p>

<p>“Then you think we’d better start back?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, say in an hour,” was the sailor’s reply.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s two o’clock,” exclaimed Bob, as he
looked at his watch. “Two hours past dinner
time. I’m starved!”</p>

<small>ADRIFT IN THE STORM</small></h2>


<p>“I guess it wouldn’t be a bad plan to eat, and
then point for home,” Sam observed. “Have
we got any grub aboard?”</p>

<p>“Plenty, trust Chunky for that,” came from
Ned. “Set it out, Bob.”</p>

<p>Bob went to the locker where the food was kept.
As he opened it he gave a start.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“There’s not much left,” the fleshy youth replied.
“I forgot to fill up the lockers last night,
and we’ve been having several picnics this week.”</p>

<p>“I guess there’s enough until we get home to
supper,” Ned put in, taking a look. “Of course
there is, Chunky. You must be especially hungry.”</p>

<p>“I am,” sighed the fat lad. “But I’ll have to
stand it, I suppose.”</p>

<p>There was just enough food and water for one
meal, but no one worried. They were only seven
miles from shore, and there was a number of boats
around them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>They ate their meal leisurely, and, when they
had finished there was a can of sardines and a
few crackers left.</p>

<p>“Hello! Where are all the other boats?” exclaimed
Jerry as he looked about. None was in
sight.</p>

<p>The sea was deserted, besides their own craft,
only the forward part of the wreck was to be seen.
The waves were still covered with floating debris.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s time we scooted,” remarked the
sailor. “The storm’s going to break sooner than
I expected. The glass is falling rapidly. Put for
shore, boys.”</p>

<p>Jerry went forward to start the engine, which
had been stopped. He turned the gasolene and
spark levers, and Bob threw over the wheel.
There was no answering explosion.</p>

<p>“Once more,” Jerry said.</p>

<p>Again Bob turned. The wheel spun around
under his efforts, but there was no chug-chug.</p>

<p>“Queer,” muttered Jerry. “What’s the trouble?
She never acts like this unless something’s
the matter. Ned, see if we have plenty of gasolene.”</p>

<p>Ned sounded the tank in the bow.</p>

<p>“Well?” inquired Jerry, as Ned seemed to be
at the operation longer than was necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>“There isn’t any.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t any?”</p>

<p>“Not a drop! See!” and he held up the
sounding stick. It was as dry as a bone, only the
odor of the fluid clinging to it.</p>

<p>“Why, it was full when we started! How
could it get out?”</p>

<p>“Well, it <em>is</em> out,” Ned replied.</p>

<p>Jerry made an examination. As much of the
tank as he could see did not appear to be damaged.
He was at a loss to account for the disappearance
of the gasolene. He looked over the
side and uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>“There’s what did it!”</p>

<p>“What?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>Jerry pointed to a small iron rod which had
pierced the bow of the <i>Dartaway</i> from the outside.
It had penetrated through the galvanized iron gasolene
tank, and the fluid had run out into the
ocean. There was enough space around the iron,
which was still in place, to allow the fluid to get
out, but, as the rod had entered in an upward, slanting
direction the hole did not admit any sea water,
so the boat did not leak.</p>

<p>“How in the world did that get there?” asked
Jerry, as he gradually worked the rod out.</p>

<p>“Must have stuck into us when we were at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
wreck,” put in Sam. “That’s just how it happened.
Good thing it was no bigger.”</p>

<p>“Lucky the gasolene didn’t all leak out until we
got away from being sucked down in the whirlpool,”
remarked Ned. “The rocking of the
boat helped it run out.”</p>

<p>“Well, what are you going to do?” inquired
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Hoist some sort of a signal,” advised Ned.
“Otherwise we’ll be here all night.”</p>

<p>“All night!” exclaimed Bob. “And no grub!
Oh, it makes me hungry to think of it!”</p>

<p>“Chunky, I would think for once you might let
up on your everlasting appetite,” came from Jerry
a little sternly. “We are just as badly off as you
are.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help it, Jerry. Just think of it, only
one can of sardines among four of us! Let’s see,
there are ten sardines in a can, that’s two and a
half each! Why, I’ve often eaten two whole
boxes myself.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be lucky if you ever eat again, sonny,”
said Sam, with an anxious look at the sky.</p>

<p>“Are we in any danger?”</p>

<p>“Well, of course we may come out all right,
but shiver my timbers, I don’t like the looks of
that bank of clouds over in the east. It’s coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
on to blow, or I’m mistaken, and that’s something
which doesn’t often happen to Salt Water Sam.”</p>

<p>“What had we better do?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“It might be a good plan to hoist a signal.
After that we can get things ship-shape, and wait.
That’s all.”</p>

<p>The <i>Dartaway’s</i> flag, upside down, a signal of
distress, was fastened to a boat-hook, that being
the tallest pole they had, and fastened in the bow.
Then, under Sam’s direction they fastened the awning
well down, and, with a bit of tarpaulin rigged
up a small sail, by means of some boat-hooks.</p>

<p>“We’ll need steerage way,” said the sailor,
“and we haven’t a drag this time.”</p>

<p>“Had we better throw overboard some of this
cargo?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“No, it’s not heavy enough to do any harm, and
it will make the boat a little steadier,” said the
sailor.</p>

<p>It was getting quite hazy by this time, and there
was a curious calm to the air, as though the storm
was just waiting for the word to break in all its
fury. The water had a strange oily look, and the
waves rolled without the least bit of foam flying
from their crests.</p>

<p>The <i>Dartaway</i> was the only craft in sight, save
where a dull blot showed that part of the wreck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
still clung to the rocks that had broken her back.
The other boats had long ago scudded for shelter.
The shore could not be discerned, and even the
lighthouse, which was usually visible for a long distance,
was wiped out.</p>

<p>There was nothing more to be done. Anxiously
the boys scanned the ocean for a sight of some
craft that might tow them in. They had no
means of moving, as there was no wind, as yet,
and they had some time ago gotten into the habit
of leaving out a pair of oars with which most
motor boats are provided to use in case of emergency.
They had seldom needed them, and they
would have been of small service, anyway, as the
craft was too heavy to be propelled in that fashion
at sea.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re as ready for it as we’ll ever be,”
remarked Sam, when he had seen for a second
time to all the fastenings. “Let her come and
get it over with.”</p>

<p>“Do you think we’d better eat now, or&mdash;or
afterward?” came from Bob.</p>

<p>“Chunky, if you mention grub again until we’re
safe ashore I’ll throw you overboard!” cried
Jerry. He had seldom spoken so sharply, and it
told of the strain he was under.</p>

<p>“There now,” came soothingly from Sam.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
“Don’t worry. If worst comes to worst we can
live for several days on ten sardines. I was on a
raft once, afloat ten days, and all I had was a pair
of boots, and one shoe lace. That was hard
lines! And we might eat the cat!”</p>

<p>“Never!” cried the boys.</p>

<p>An hour or more passed, with the <i>Dartaway</i>
drifting aimlessly on the ocean, which was beginning
to heave as if from the influence of some
hidden power. It grew much darker, though it
was only about five o’clock.</p>

<p>“Do you s’pose the life-savers will see us?”
asked Ned. “They have a station near here,
where they came out from to rescue those from the
wreck.”</p>

<p>“No chance of them seeing us this far out,”
said Sam. “They could see where the wreck was
in the mist, as it sent up signal lights. But we
haven’t any.”</p>

<p>“I’ll always carry them after this,” spoke Jerry.</p>

<p>The inverted pennant of the boat fluttered a
little in the breeze. The haze seemed to grow
thicker. The sailor stood up and looked on all
sides. Then he tightened the ropes holding the
improvised sail, and made it smaller in area, not
by reefing it, for there was no way of doing that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
but by setting it lower on the rigged “jury” mast.
He also took down the ensign.</p>

<p>“No need of losing that,” he said, “and it’s
sure to go when the blow comes. It can’t be seen
a quarter of a mile away now.”</p>

<p>Now, over the waters, came a strange, weird
sound, as though some one had blown on a big
conch shell, miles away. It grew in volume until
it filled all the air. The boys looked about in
wonder.</p>

<p>“It’s the wind! Here comes the storm!”
cried Sam.</p>

<p>An instant later the blast came. It flattened
down the heaving waves for a few seconds, and
then blew off their tops in a spray of foam.</p>

<p>The motor boat heeled over, as though it would
capsize. Then the small sail filled out. All at
once the wind seemed to die away. But, a few
seconds later it came with increased fury.</p>

<p>“It’s shifted!” cried Sam. “We’re being
blown out to sea!”</p>

<p>The <i>Dartaway</i> spun around like a top, and
scudded through the waves.</p>
</div>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a><br />
<small>NODDY’S COMPANION</small></h2>


<p>Now the storm had broken in all its power.
How the wind whistled over the boat, almost tearing
the awning loose! But Sam had seen to the
fastenings, and the old sailor well knew the awful
force of a gale. The sail, too, held, though it
needed all the strength of the ropes Sam had carefully
placed here and there to brace it.</p>

<p>“Take the wheel!” roared Sam to Jerry.
“I’ll look after things here!”</p>

<p>Making his way as best he could along the rolling
and pitching boat, Jerry grasped the steering
apparatus. It was all he could do to hold the
helm, so violently was the rudder twisted from
side to side.</p>

<p>Well for those aboard the <i>Dartaway</i> that she
was a stanch craft, well that she had been built
with a view to hard service. For now her stoutness
was called upon, and now was her stability
likely to be tested to the utmost.</p>

<p>Once the first fury of the blast was over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
boys did not seem to mind it so much. It did not
appear to blow so hard when they were scudding
along with the wind. The sea was soon a rolling
mass of billows, but the <i>Dartaway</i> with her watertight
compartments, rode over the waves like a
duck. True, she was tossed here and there, but
her covered bow and stern did not allow any water
to enter, while the spray, except now and then in a
violent gust, was prevented from coming aboard
by the stout awning.</p>

<p>The red and green side lights had been set
aglow some time before, though it is doubtful if
they could be seen ten feet away, because of the
tossing waves.</p>

<p>“Let’s start the search-light,” said Ned. “It
will show us where we are going and prevent us
being run down.”</p>

<p>Sam said it would be a good plan, and the
beacon was soon ignited, sending out its glaring
pencil of light over the dark and angry waters.</p>

<p>“She’ll stand to come in a bit,” called Sam to
Jerry. “Hold as close to the wind as you can,
and we’ll try and scud along the coast. We may
fetch up somewhere on a point if we’re not too far
out.”</p>

<p>Jerry shifted the wheel, and the <i>Dartaway</i>,
answering well to her new power, changed her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
course. Suddenly it began to rain, a downpour
so violent that it served in a measure to flatten
down the crests of the waves.</p>

<p>Though the rain served this good turn, it was
unwelcome on another account. Tight as the awning
was, much water now came in through the flaps
that would blow open a bit, in spite of Sam’s
efforts. In a little while there was scarcely a dry
spot aboard the boat, and the occupants were wet
through.</p>

<p>But, in spite of their terror (and the boys were
not ashamed to admit they were frightened); in
spite of their plight which was about as bad as
could be, there was a certain feeling of pride in
their boat. It was a gallant craft, and the lads,
more than ever, felt the <i>Dartaway</i> was a friend
indeed.</p>

<p>On and on the wind drove her. It was impossible
to tell where they were. The searchlight
showed a waste of heaving waters and a downpour
of rain, that fell on the top of the canopy
as though it would beat it down about the heads
of the occupants of the craft. The wind blew
more steadily now.</p>

<p>“We’re all right,” spoke Sam, encouragingly.
“We’ll weather the gale.”</p>

<p>A small acetylene lamp inside the awnings gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
light and by its glow Ned made some coffee on the
gasolene stove. It took the last of their slender
supply of water, but Sam said they had better keep
their strength up through the storm, as they would
probably get help by morning. Then, with the
ten sardines and the crackers they made a midnight
lunch which, in spite of the surrounding, was much
enjoyed.</p>

<p>Through the whole of the night they were
driven by the storm. How he steered Jerry never
knew. It was going it blind, in the dark. But
the <i>Dartaway</i> carried them safe, and, when morning
dawned, the rain had ceased, the sun came up
and the wind had become merely a fresh breeze.
It had shifted its direction again, at which Sam,
after a glance at the compass, uttered a joyful
cry.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t be better,” he announced. “It’ll
take us right back home again. Say, you boys are
certainly lucky!”</p>

<p>They opened the awnings and let the boat dry
out. Then, with the wind at their backs, filling
the sail, which had been made as large as possible,
they headed for home.</p>

<p>“No breakfast!” sighed Chunky, but to himself.
He did not want the others to overhear.</p>

<p>No one except the fleshy youth seemed to mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the lack of food, however, though all were very
thirsty, and there was not a drop of water aboard.</p>

<p>“We ought to make land by noon, at this rate,”
Sam said.</p>

<p>Chunky said nothing, but he pulled his belt a
little tighter across his stomach. He seemed to
feel better, when he had thus reduced the “size
of his hunger.”</p>

<p>It was about ten o’clock that morning when
Sam, who was steering, cried:</p>

<p>“There’s the lighthouse, boys! We’ll put in
there for repairs.”</p>

<p>There, looming up in the sun was the big white
tower that stood on a rocky point which jutted out
from the main land. It was still several miles
away, but their present course was taking them
straight toward it. It was the lower or South
light, as it was called, the one the boys had intended
to visit, but which they had not as yet.</p>

<p>“I hope he’s got gasolene there,” said Jerry.
“I can mend the tank, and we can soon be home.”</p>

<p>“I guess Peter Hardack, the keeper, can fix
you up,” spoke Sam. “He keeps a lot of supplies
on hand.”</p>

<p>An hour later they were at the lighthouse. The
keeper saw them coming and was down to his small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
dock to meet them. When he saw Sam the keeper
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“If it isn’t my old friend! What have you
done, turned motor pirate?”</p>

<p>The sailor briefly explained their plight.</p>

<p>“Come right in!” exclaimed the hospitable
Mr. Hardack. “I’ll get you some breakfast and
you can dry your clothes.”</p>

<p>“Have you any gasolene, and can we send a
message to Harmon Beach?” asked Jerry
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Both, sonny. Come right in.”</p>

<p>The boat was made fast to the dock, and the
little party of mariners were escorted into the living
rooms of the lighthouse, which were in a small
apartment built around the base of the tower.</p>

<p>“Here Jessica!” called Mr. Hardack. “Jessica!
Where are you?”</p>

<p>“Coming, uncle,” called a voice, and a tall
pretty girl entered the room, stopping in confusion
at the sight of the strangers.</p>

<p>“Here are some almost-shipwrecked people,”
the keeper went on with a smile. “They want
some hot coffee, and anything else you have.”</p>

<p>“Don’t go to any trouble,” said Ned, and Bob
glared at his chum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh it’s no trouble. My niece will see to
things. And take care of the cat, too.”</p>

<p>While breakfast was being prepared Jerry telephoned
to a hotel near his mother’s house and
asked that a message be sent to relieve her worry.
Then, having borrowed some old clothes of the
keeper, the boys and Sam dried their own.</p>

<p>After breakfast Jerry mended the leak in the
gasolene tank, and, buying some of the fluid from
the keeper, soon had the <i>Dartaway</i> in shape for
another voyage. They bade their new friends
good-bye, receiving an invitation to come again,
and soon they were back at Harmon Beach.
They took the cat with them and Mrs. Hopkins
made a pet of it.</p>

<p>They found there was some excitement over
their absence all night, but Mrs. Hopkins had
come to regard the boys’ escapades with a sort of
philosophy. She believed the lads would turn up
all right somehow.</p>

<p>Sam attended to the matter of the salvaged
cargo. An agent for the steamer came to the
beach, and took charge of all the stuff that had
been saved from the sea. The sailor and the boys
received a goodly sum for the valuable bark they
had saved.</p>

<p>It was about a week after this that the three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
lads had gone in their boat to a small summer resort
about three miles down the coast, where there
were varied amusement features. They took in
several of them, and, as they were strolling along
the boardwalk, getting ready to come home, Jerry
nudged Ned.</p>

<p>“Who’s that just ahead of us?” he asked.</p>

<p>Ned looked. At that moment a girl and a
youth just in advance of the three boys came under
an electric light.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s Noddy Nixon!” exclaimed Ned in
a whisper.</p>

<p>“And who’s with him?”</p>

<p>“The girl from the lighthouse! Jessica!”</p>
</div>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a><br />
<small>A RACE WITH NODDY</small></h2>


<p>For a few moments the boys were too surprised
to know what to say. They trailed along after
Noddy and the girl, noting that the two seemed to
be enjoying themselves. As the couple entered
an ice cream store Jerry remarked:</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a free country. He can take out
any girl he likes, I suppose, and we haven’t anything
to do with her.”</p>

<p>“It makes me mad to see a nice girl like that
out with such a fellow as Noddy,” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“Ah, I guess Ned’s lost his heart,” spoke Bob.</p>

<p>“Lost nothing!” sputtered Ned. “But you
know what sort of a chap Noddy Nixon is.
Would you want him to go out with any girl you
knew?”</p>

<p>“But you don’t know this one,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“I’ve been introduced to her,” replied Ned.
“But I suppose it’s none of our business. Come
on, let’s go home.”</p>

<p>“I guess Ned is rather smitten with Jessica,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
remarked Jerry in a low voice to Bob, as they
started for Harmon Beach.</p>

<p>“Don’t blame him,” came from Bob. “She’s
a fine girl.”</p>

<p>On the way home the chums talked over
Noddy’s sudden reappearance. They agreed he
was not a pleasant acquaintance to have, but decided
as long as he did not interfere with them
they could do nothing.</p>

<p>“I wonder if Bill Berry is still around,” said
Ned. “Haven’t heard anything from him
lately.”</p>

<p>“That’s one thing I forgot when we were at
the lighthouse,” spoke Jerry. “I meant to ask
Mr. Hardack if he had a helper, but it slipped my
mind.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you were too busy looking at
Jessica,” came from Bob.</p>

<p>“Not exactly,” replied his chum. “But I must
admit I had a strange feeling when I heard the
keeper call her Jessica. I thought of the man in
the wreck.”</p>

<p>“She can’t be the same one,” argued Ned.
“He was an old man, and his daughter must be
quite a woman by this time. Jessica is only a girl.
Besides, her name is different.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“Jess and Jessica might be the same,” put in
Bob.</p>

<p>“There are lots of things that might happen,”
Jerry commented. “We’ll have to wait and see
what turns up.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to the lighthouse again?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p>“We might,” Jerry replied. “I want to ask
about Bill Berry. But you needn’t come along.”</p>

<p>“I guess I’ve got as good a right there as you
have.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course, but I thought you might not
like to see Jessica, seeing that she had such bad
taste as to go out with Noddy Nixon.”</p>

<p>“She doesn’t know him as well as we do,” said
Ned hotly.</p>

<p>“Never mind, I was only joking,” Jerry added.
“We’ll all go to the lighthouse, and see what we
can learn.”</p>

<p>When the boys got home that night they found
Sam awaiting them. He was in the dining room
and was telling Mrs. Hopkins some of his sea
stories. Jerry’s mother was much interested in the
old sailor.</p>

<p>“Want to go blue fishing to-morrow?” Sam
asked, when the boys had begun eating a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
lunch the cook sent in, probably in honor of Bob.</p>

<p>“Sure!” was the cry in a chorus.</p>

<p>“They’re running fine,” the sailor replied.
“Old Pete Scud went out to-day and got forty-five.”</p>

<p>They arranged to go the next day, and started
early in the morning. They had excellent sport,
and the boys landed several beauties.</p>

<p>“What will we do with them all?” asked Jerry
as he looked at the pile of fish in the big basket in
the boat.</p>

<p>“We can sell most of ’em,” replied the sailor.
“The rest you can give to your friends.”</p>

<p>“Can I have a couple of the big ones?” asked
Ned.</p>

<p>“Sure,” answered Jerry. “What do you want
’em for?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to make a present of them.”</p>

<p>Sam was given the larger part of the catch, the
boys keeping enough for the cottage, while Ned
took two of the finest ones.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with them?” asked
Jerry, as they got back to the dock about noon.</p>

<p>“Well if you must know I thought I’d take
them to Mr. Hardack at the lighthouse. He
probably likes fish.”</p>

<p>“Probably Jessica does, also,” put in Bob, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
a grin that caused Ned to make a sudden lunge at
his chum.</p>

<p>“We’ll go with you,” said Jerry. “Take the
fish along, Ned. It will be a sort of love offering,”
and he laughed, while Ned blushed.</p>

<p>That afternoon the three boys in their boat
started for the South Light, as it was called to
distinguished it from the next one above, or the
North. The fish had been packed in ice to keep
them fresh, Ned attending to this item with much
care.</p>

<p>The day was a fine one, and as the <i>Dartaway</i>
sped out of the harbor and round the point, preparatory
to going down the coast, the boys chanted
one of Salt Water Sam’s odd songs.</p>

<p>“This is glorious!” cried Bob. “I wish it
would last forever. A life on the ocean wave for
me all right.”</p>

<p>“Except when we run out of grub,” put in
Ned, with a grin.</p>

<p>As they swung down along the coast, the boat
making good speed, their attention was attracted
to the puffing of a craft just behind them. They
looked and saw another motor boat coming along
at a lively clip. In it were two figures.</p>

<p>“Don’t let them pass us,” called Jerry to Ned,
who was at the wheel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t worry. It’ll have to be a pretty good
boat to pass the <i>Dartaway</i>.”</p>

<p>The newcomer seemed inclined to race. He
was getting his engine up to top speed, and the
pile of water in front of the bow of his craft
showed he meant business.</p>

<p>The boys began to sit up and take notice. They
saw that the other boat was a swift one, and, as it
was a trifle smaller than theirs, and narrower, it
stood a better chance. But they were not going
to give up so easily.</p>

<p>Jerry and Bob began oiling the motor while
Ned settled down to business. He shoved the
levers over, and, for a while ran the <i>Dartaway</i> on
second speed. By this time the other boat was
about opposite them.</p>

<p>“Can you see who’s in it?” asked Jerry of
Ned.</p>

<p>“No. Seems to be a fellow and a girl. He
has a cap on, and I can’t see his face. Her hair
blows about her so I can’t make out who she is.”</p>

<p>The occupant of the other boat evidently had
accepted the race, and was doing his best to win.
He was steering a straight course, and the two
craft were not more than a hundred yards
apart.</p>

<p>They kept it up for a couple of miles, the engines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
exploding away like a battery of Gatling
guns in full action. Gradually the <i>Dartaway</i> began
to draw ahead. Inch by inch she left her
opponent behind, until he was hopelessly out of
the race.</p>

<p>“Better slow down now,” cautioned Jerry.
“We’re close to the lighthouse.”</p>

<p>Ned shut off some power, and, a few minutes
later, steered the boat up to the small dock at
the base of the lighthouse.</p>

<p>“Glad to see you!” called a voice, and the
keeper came down the stone steps to welcome them.
“Haven’t been out in any more storms, have
you?”</p>

<p>“Not lately,” replied Jerry. “How are
you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, things are always the same here. Come
in and have a bite to eat. My niece is away but
I’m pretty good at setting the table.”</p>

<p>Ned’s face showed the disappointment he felt.</p>

<p>“Here are some fish we caught,” he said, offering
them to Mr. Hardack.</p>

<p>“Well now! Say, that’s kind of you. I
was just wishing for some blues, and I haven’t
time to get any. I told my helper to get some,
but he’s not as spry as he might be.”</p>

<p>“What’s his name,” asked Jerry, thinking this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
a good opening to find out what he wanted to
know.</p>

<p>“Merry&mdash;no, it ain’t Merry, it’s Cherry&mdash;no,
it ain’t Cherry either&mdash;land I am forgetful.
It’s some name like that. Berry&mdash;that’s it&mdash;William
Berry. I’ve only had him a few weeks.
My other man took sick and I had to get one in
a hurry.”</p>

<p>The boys looked at each other. None of them
dared to make a remark, but Jerry seemed much
excited.</p>

<p>“Come on in,” went on Mr. Hardack. “Well
I declare, there’s another boat coming. That
must be Jessica. She went out for a cruise with
a young chap she met at an entertainment or something
the other night.”</p>

<p>The boys looked and saw the craft they had
lately raced with coming to the dock. In a little
while it was so close they could make out the features
of those in the motor boat.</p>

<p>The girl was Jessica, and the youth was Noddy
Nixon.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br />
<small>OVERHEARING A PLOT</small></h2>


<p>Noddy was so much engaged in making a landing
at the dock that he did not observe the three
boys until he had come up alongside the string
piece. Then, as he glanced up, he muttered an
exclamation below his breath.</p>

<p>“Oh, uncle, I had a lovely ride!” exclaimed
Jessica, as she got out. “It was glorious! Oh,
there are the boys who were almost shipwrecked
the other night,” and she bowed to the motor lads.</p>

<p>“Well, now you must all come in and have a
glass of milk and some cake,” said Mr. Hardack.
“Jessica bakes fine cake.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way uncle flatters me!” exclaimed
the girl with a laugh. “But come in, all of you;
please do.”</p>

<p>The motor boys were in a quandary. They
wanted to see the workings of the lighthouse,
which they had been told were quite novel. Ned
had to admit he wanted to see Jessica, and Jerry
was anxious to get more information about Bill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Berry. As for Noddy, he did not seem to know
what to do. He was fumbling at the painter of
the boat he was in.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you coming in, Mr. Nixon?” asked
Jessica.</p>

<p>“I forgot&mdash;I have an engagement,” muttered
Noddy. He bent over the engine and was cranking
it up. “I’ll see you again, Miss Jessica,” he
called, and with a bow, he steered his boat away
from the dock.</p>

<p>“Well, you three boys come in,” insisted the
keeper. “We have very little company here, and
we must make the most of it. See the fine blue
fish they brought me, Jessica.”</p>

<p>“They’re lovely,” the girl said, though she
looked a little troubled. Ned wondered if she regretted
Noddy’s departure.</p>

<p>Over the simple lunch which was soon set out
the boys grew better acquainted with the keeper
and his niece. She mentioned that she had met
Noddy at a sociable where a girl companion had
introduced her to him.</p>

<p>“He’s very nice to me,” Jessica confided to
Ned. “He is going to take me for a long ride
in the boat some day. It’s very fast, even if you
did beat us to-day. His engine wasn’t working
right, or he’d have come in first.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>Ned tried to turn the conversation. He did
not want to talk about Noddy behind his back.</p>

<p>“There’s my assistant,” spoke Mr. Hardack,
as he pointed out of the window. Jerry and his
chums looked. Though they said nothing they
had no difficulty in recognizing Bill Berry. He
was filling some lanterns at an oil box in the yard.</p>

<p>“I don’t much fancy him,” the keeper went on.
“He’s too silent. This is a lonesome place, and
I like persons who can talk. I hope you boys will
come again.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be glad to,” Jerry replied.</p>

<p>Mr. Hardack showed them all over the lighthouse.
They inspected the machinery, which, by
means of weights, revolved the frame containing
the powerful lenses.</p>

<p>“We flash one white light and two red lights
at intervals,” explained the keeper.</p>

<p>“And if anything should interfere with the
proper workings of the machinery, I suppose there
would be danger,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess so! The sailors depend on seeing
a white flash and two red ones when they get
here. It means keep out. Why we even have an
emergency apparatus, so that if the automatic one
breaks we can turn the lenses by hand. The government
doesn’t want any failure of the light.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys were shown through the store room,
near the kitchen, where the oil and other supplies
were kept. The lighthouse was some distance
from any settlement, and in stormy weather it was
hard to get food and other necessities. So a
goodly supply was kept in stock.</p>

<p>“I think we’d better be going,” remarked Jerry,
as he looked at his watch and noted it was four
o’clock. He wanted to get off with his chums and
talk over matters.</p>

<p>“Don’t be in a hurry,” spoke Mr. Hardack.
“We don’t get enough company as it is, do we
Jessica?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed, uncle.”</p>

<p>“Did you ask if there was any mail?” asked
the keeper, of his niece.</p>

<p>“Yes, I stopped at the post-office when I was
out with Mr. Nixon, but there were no letters.”</p>

<p>“Strange; we ought to hear pretty soon now,”
and the keeper seemed worried about something.</p>

<p>“I’m sure we’re much obliged for showing us
the place,” put in Ned, and then he started out,
followed by his chums. Mr. Hardack went down
to the dock with them. On the way Jerry tried to
get a look at Bill Berry, who was still busy filling
lamps, but the man kept his back turned.</p>

<p>“Now don’t forget to come again,” Mr. Hardack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
went on, as the boys got in their boat. “You
see my niece is sort of lonesome. That’s the reason
I let her go off with that Nixon fellow once
in a while, though I don’t exactly like him. She
wants cheering up.”</p>

<p>“Is anything the matter?” inquired Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, you see her father, he&mdash;”</p>

<p>But the rest of what Mr. Hardack would have
said was lost as, just then, Bob started the motor,
and it made such a noise until Jerry slowed it
down, that the keeper’s words were inaudible.
When the noise had ceased the boat was some distance
from the dock, and Mr. Hardack was waving
them a farewell. Ned thought he saw a handkerchief
shaken from a window in the lighthouse,
but was not sure.</p>

<p>“I wonder what he was going to say about her
father,” Jerry said, when they had headed the
boat for home.</p>

<p>“He’s dead, probably,” Ned spoke. “She
dresses in black, you notice.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t notice particularly, but it seems you
did.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got eyes,” was all Ned replied.</p>

<p>“Queer Noddy should be sporting around there
in a motor boat,” said Bob. “I wonder where he
got it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>“Bought it, same as we did,” came from Jerry,
“or hired it. His father keeps him supplied with
money, in spite of his escapades.”</p>

<p>The boys paid several other visits to the lighthouse,
and each time received a warm welcome.
They found Jessica home only once; the other occasions
she was out riding with Noddy Nixon, her
uncle said.</p>

<p>“He’s getting altogether too thick around
here,” the keeper complained. “I don’t want to
say anything, as Jess needs cheering up, and I
guess he isn’t such a bad sort. One thing I don’t
like though, he and that helper of mine, seem to
have some sort of a secret between them.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?” asked Jerry, trying to speak
as though he did not much care.</p>

<p>“Well, I was surprised to notice that a rich
young chap, such as this Nixon boy seems to be,
would know a fellow like Bill Berry. Bill’s a
good enough worker, but he’s a sort of shiftless
man, and I don’t know much about him. He’s
tramped around considerable, he tells me, and I
reckon there’s lots he hasn’t told me. But one
day I saw him and young Nixon talking as though
they had known each other all their lives. Now
wouldn’t that strike you as being sort of queer?”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, maybe it’s all right,” spoke Jerry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
warning his chums, with a look, to say nothing.</p>

<p>“But that’s not all. The other day I saw
young Nixon pass Bill a note, and when he saw I
was watching, he got red, as though it was something
to be ashamed of. I don’t like it, and I’m
going to be on the watch.”</p>

<p>On their way home that afternoon, from the
lighthouse, the boys talked over what Mr. Hardack
had said.</p>

<p>“What do you make of it?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“It’s hard to say,” replied Jerry. “Maybe
they’re up to some of their old tricks, trying to get
us into trouble.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and maybe they’re trying to get Mr.
Hardack and Jessica into trouble,” put in Ned.</p>

<p>“Jealous, eh?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Well I guess you don’t like to see Noddy
Nixon paying attention to Jessica, or to any other
nice girl for that matter, any more than I do. I
don’t know as that’s jealousy.”</p>

<p>“No, you’re right,” came from Jerry, who
spoke in a serious tone. “Of course we have
nothing to go by, but I think there’s something in
the wind. I am almost certain Bill Berry stole
that diamond ring from the bath house, and I’m
going to tell Professor Snodgrass what I know
about it. I shall also inform him where Bill is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
and he can do as he pleases about having him arrested.”</p>

<p>“What about Noddy?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“We’ll see what develops. Maybe Noddy is
mixed up in it, though I don’t really believe he’d
steal.”</p>

<p>That night the boys, in their boat, went to the
amusement resort, where they had first seen Noddy
walking with Jessica. There was a minstrel performance
scheduled, for the benefit of the local
hospital. As they tied the craft to the dock,
among a score of other boats, Ned remarked:</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll stay here, fellows. I don’t much
feel like taking in the show.”</p>

<p>“Want to sit and think of Jessica,” said Jerry,
with a laugh. “Well you are certainly getting
moony, old chap. You’d better take some liver
medicine. Come on, Bob, we’ll see the fun.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and get something to eat, too. Better
come, Ned.”</p>

<p>“No thanks, I’ll stay here.”</p>

<p>It was really nothing more than a whim on his
part to remain behind in the boat. Ned was
really getting quite fond of the girl at the lighthouse,
but he did not admit it, even to himself.
He had a vague feeling that he would like to be
alone and think.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>He stretched out on some cushions in the bottom
of the craft, and was star-gazing to his heart’s
content. Next to the <i>Dartaway</i> was a large sailing
sloop, which was there when the boys made
fast to the dock. The high sides threw a deep
shadow over the motor craft. Ned was disturbed
from his reveries by the sound of some
one walking along the dock. It had been silent
for some time, save for the distant sound of the
music, and at first he believed the boys were coming
back. Then he heard voices he knew were
not those of his chums.</p>

<p>“Is this the sloop?” asked a man.</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the answer. “Get aboard where
we can talk without being overheard, though I
guess there’s no one around.”</p>

<p>Ned could hear the men going aboard the sailing
craft. They went into the cabin, and then
some one opened a port just above the boy’s head,
as he was stretched out in the motor boat.</p>

<p>“It’s beastly hot in here,” some one said.</p>

<p>“Yes, been shut up all day. Now, how much
have you got done?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve found the steamer’s due here in a
few days now, and it’s got a valuable cargo
aboard. Stuff that will float easily. We ought
to be able to pick up a lot of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>“How about the lights?”</p>

<p>“That’s all arranged. Bill has a job at the
place and he is going to be in charge that night.
It’s Hardack’s time off, and Bill will fix the lights
so’s to fool the pilot of the steamer.”</p>

<p>“How’s he going to do it?”</p>

<p>“Just cover the one flash, and make only two
flashes just like the North light gives.”</p>

<p>“Is there any one else likely to give trouble?”</p>

<p>“There’s only the girl, and we can easily get
her out of the way. Oh, it’s going to be easy.
We’ll be there to help Bill if he needs it. Now&mdash;what’s
that?”</p>

<p>The voices suddenly ceased.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a><br />
<small>THE MOTOR BOAT MISSING</small></h2>


<p>In his eagerness to listen to what the men were
saying Ned had gotten up on his knees. In doing
so he had knocked down a monkey wrench
from a seat, and the tool fell with a clatter to the
bottom of the <i>Dartaway</i>.</p>

<p>“Some one is listening!” he heard one of the
men in the sloop exclaim.</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” the other replied. “It was only
an oar banging against the side of the boat.”</p>

<p>“Some one was listening I tell you! I’m going
out to take a look.”</p>

<p>Ned decided it would not be wise for him to
be found in the boat. While the man was ascending
to the deck of the sloop the boy crawled noiselessly
over the side of the <i>Dartaway</i> and hid behind
a box on the wharf. From there Ned
watched the man leap from the sailing boat to the
dock, and take a careful look around, including
making an inspection of the <i>Dartaway</i>.</p>

<p>“See anything?” asked the one who had remained
in the cabin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>“No one around. I guess you were right.”</p>

<p>“Course I was. Come aboard and we’ll finish
our plans.”</p>

<p>With a rapidly beating heart Ned watched the
man until he had disappeared into the cabin.
Then without making any noise, for he wore rubber
soled shoes, he hurried up the dock to the
pavilion where the minstrel performance was going
on. He wanted to tell his chums and decide
on a plan of action.</p>

<p>“They’re plotting to wreck a vessel,” thought
Ned. “They’re going to do something to the
lighthouse light. We must stop them.”</p>

<p>There was such a big crowd at the show that
the boy had some difficulty in locating his companions.
When he did find them it was in the
middle of a chorus, and Ned did not wish to disturb
the audience in going to them, as the two
lads were seated well up front. When he did
reach them he whispered:</p>

<p>“Come out! I’ve got something important to
tell you!”</p>

<p>“Leave us alone,” spoke Bob. “Go back and
dream about Jessica if you want to. This is fine,
and we haven’t eaten yet.”</p>

<p>“Oh, hang you and your eating!” exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Ned in such a loud whisper that he attracted the
attention of several around him.</p>

<p>His manner showed his chums there was something
up, and without waiting for the show to be
over they went with Ned. When he was outside
he quickly told them what he had heard.</p>

<p>“Are you sure you weren’t dreaming?” asked
Jerry, half inclined to doubt what Ned had related.</p>

<p>“Come on, and I’ll show you the sloop.”</p>

<p>The boys went down on the end of the dock
where their own, as well as the sailing vessel had
been fastened. Ned was leading the way. As
he reached the place where the <i>Dartaway</i> had
been he stopped and rubbed his eyes.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;why&mdash;I wonder if I’m on the
wrong dock?” he said, staring about him.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” inquired Jerry.</p>

<p>“Isn’t this where we left our boat?”</p>

<p>“Sure, there’s only one dock near here.
Why?”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s gone.”</p>

<p>“What, the boat or the dock?” asked Bob.
“Come on, tell us, I want to get back and have
something to eat.”</p>

<p>“The <i>Dartaway</i> is gone!” exclaimed Ned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
“So is the sloop! They’ve stolen our boat!
They must suspect something!”</p>

<p>At first Jerry and Bob could not believe it.
Then Ned went over again all that he had heard,
telling how he had slipped away to inform them
of how matters stood.</p>

<p>“They must have known it was our boat,” said
Jerry. “Was Bill Berry one of the men?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t see them plainly,” Ned replied.
“Their voices didn’t either one of them sound
like Bill’s though. What’s to be done?”</p>

<p>“We’d better give notice of our boat being
stolen,” said Jerry, “and think of some scheme
to get home. After that we’ll have to turn detectives
and get the <i>Dartaway</i>.”</p>

<p>The minstrel show was over when the boys
went back to the pavilion, and the crowd was
coming away. The dock was thronged with persons
seeking their boats to make the run for home.</p>

<p>“Hello boys!” called a voice, and they saw
Captain Jenkinson, of the <i>Three Bells</i> coming
toward them. “You look as if something had
happened.”</p>

<p>“Something has,” spoke Jerry. “Our boat’s
been stolen.”</p>

<p>“Stolen! You don’t mean it. How?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>Ned related how it had happened, saying nothing
however of the conversation he had overheard.</p>

<p>“We’ll tell the manager of the place, and he’ll
send out a general alarm,” said the skipper of the
<i>Three Bells</i>. “It isn’t the first time boats have
been stolen from the docks around here. I believe
there’s an organized gang. If we had a
decent police force here it wouldn’t happen so
often.”</p>

<p>The manager of the pavilion and amusement
resort, who was also a sort of deputy sheriff, promised
the boys to do what he could to recover their
craft. He said he would have notices of the
theft posted at his dock and all the other wharves
along the coast.</p>

<p>“How you boys going to get home?” asked
Captain Jenkinson.</p>

<p>“Walk I guess,” replied Jerry with a laugh.
“It’s only about five miles by the shore road.”</p>

<p>“Well I guess you’ll not walk while there’s
gasolene in the <i>Three Bells</i>,” was the hearty
answer. “Get aboard. We’ll cruise around a
bit, and maybe we’ll get sight of those rascals on
the sloop. They probably sailed out to sea, towing
your boat, and they’ll be likely to hide it in
some cove until the affair blows over.”</p>

<p>Captain Jenkinson had a party of friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
aboard his boat, but there was plenty of room for
the boys. There was much sympathy expressed
for them, and every one volunteered to be on the
lookout for the <i>Dartaway</i>.</p>

<p>In the powerful boat quite an area of the bay
in the vicinity of the dock was covered, in a search
for a sight of the sloop. It was a fairly light
night, and a sailing vessel could be made out some
distance away.</p>

<p>There were several false alarms, and once the
<i>Three Bells</i> gave chase to a sloop that seemed trying
to get away. But when they got up to her
they found it was only a fishing boat getting a
start for early morning work, and there was no
sign of the boys’ craft.</p>

<p>“Too bad!” remarked Captain Jenkinson, as
he landed the boys at their dock. “But it’s sure
to turn up sooner or later. They’ll not dare to
sell her, and can only keep her hidden. There
are not many places where a boat the size of yours
can be tucked away.”</p>

<p>It was kindly and well meant consolation, but
the boys never felt in lower spirits than they did
that night. Mrs. Hopkins tried to cheer them
up, but it was hard work. She even suggested
they hire another boat and make a search of the
nearby harbors, for the missing one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>“I guess that’s a good plan,” said Jerry to his
chums. “We’ll do it to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“What ought we to do about warning Mr.
Hardack?” asked Ned, as they got ready to retire.</p>

<p>“Oh, I almost forgot about that,” came from
Jerry. “I guess there will be time in the morning.
Besides, we want to think it over a little
more.”</p>

<small>THE SECRET OF THE COVE</small></h2>


<p>The boys made inquiries the next morning
and found it would be impossible to hire another
motor boat. The season was at its height and
all the craft were engaged. Several of their
newly-made friends offered them the use of their
boats for a part of each day, but the boys did not
want to take them on this condition. Besides,
they wanted to be away by themselves, as they
had much to talk about.</p>

<p>“Hadn’t we better warn Mr. Hardack?”
asked Ned, when they had exhausted the possibilities
of hiring a boat.</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking of it,” Jerry said, “and I
don’t see what particular good it would do. We
only know half the story. Besides, those fellows
might only have been talking to hear themselves
talk. It’s a mighty risky thing to wreck a vessel
and tamper with a lighthouse. They wouldn’t
dare do it.”</p>

<p>“But it wouldn’t do any harm to tell the keeper
what we know,” Ned insisted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“Only to get laughed at for our pains, in case
nothing happened. Besides, how are we going to
get to the lighthouse without a boat?”</p>

<p>“We can walk around by the shore, it’s not
more than ten miles,” went on Ned.</p>

<p>“Love will find a way,” sang Bob, and he had
to jump back to escape a playful blow Ned aimed
at him.</p>

<p>“I suppose we could,” remarked Jerry.
“Maybe it wouldn’t do any harm to go around
there and see how the land lays. We can sort of
give him a hint, and warn him to be on the lookout
for Bill Berry.”</p>

<p>“That will be a good plan,” agreed Ned.
“When can we start? The sooner the better.”</p>

<p>“Not until after dinner, I vote,” from Bob.
“I can’t walk on an empty stomach.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you ever tried,” Jerry said.</p>

<p>The boys inquired the best way to get to the
lighthouse by going along the shore, and learned
it was about eight miles. They started after
lunch, and hard enough walking they found it,
as most of the way lay through deep sand.</p>

<p>“This is awful,” groaned Bob as he toiled
along.</p>

<p>“Dry up, Chunky,” from Ned. “It will do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
you good. Besides, think of what a service
you may be doing.”</p>

<p>“I’m thinking about my chances for supper.”</p>

<p>The boys had gone about half the distance and
were going along a series of high sand dunes,
covered with a growth of tall, rank grass, when
they were suddenly halted by a voice calling to
them:</p>

<p>“Where you fellows going?”</p>

<p>They looked up, to see a roughly dressed man
barring the path.</p>

<p>“I don’t know’s it’s any of your business,”
Jerry replied hotly, for he resented the man’s tone.
“This is a free country.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, my young friend,” the man
said with a sneer, “but this is private property,
and we don’t allow any trespassing on it. So
you’d better be off if you know what’s good for
you.”</p>

<p>“Can’t we go along the beach?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“No, sir, you can’t go anywhere along here.
We own for two miles back, and if you try to pass
here you’ll get into trouble. So be off!”</p>

<p>The boys hesitated. There was no way of
proving that what the man said was not so, and
they did not want to get into trouble. To get
past meant walking two miles back in shore. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
they stood there, wondering what to do, another
man came from somewhere in the tall grass and
said to the first:</p>

<p>“The boat’s in the cove. Floated in at high
tide.”</p>

<p>“That’ll do!” was the quick retort, as though
the first man feared his companion would say
too much. “I’m warning these chaps off our
land.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and they’d better go if they know what’s
good for them,” said the other.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll go,” came from Jerry. “We don’t
care about walking on your property. I guess
we can manage without doing so.”</p>

<p>The three lads turned and began to walk inland,
across the waste of sand, which was hot with
the afternoon sun. The coast at this point was
rather high, there being a series of bluffs, which
sloped abruptly down to the beach.</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” asked Jerry when they
were out of earshot of the men.</p>

<p>“Nothing to do but to go around their place,”
said Ned. “It will mean about four miles
more.”</p>

<p>Bob groaned.</p>

<p>“It’ll get some of that fat off you, Chunky,”
Jerry remarked with a laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s all right enough for you to joke,” growled
the fleshy youth. “But I can’t help it.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what he meant by saying the boat
was in the cove?” came from Ned.</p>

<p>“I was thinking about that myself,” Jerry put
in. “I didn’t know there was a cove along here.”</p>

<p>“Let’s take a look,” suggested Ned.</p>

<p>“How can we, without going back and meeting
the men?”</p>

<p>“Easy enough,” came from Jerry. “We’ll
walk along for a mile or so, then cut down along
parallel to the coast and walk back toward the
beach. We ought to come out right back of the
cove, if there is one, or very near to it.”</p>

<p>This was voted a good plan to follow, and, with
no further objections from Bob, the boys trudged
along. It was hot and hard work, but they were
very anxious to find out the secret of the cove, as
they believed the men had some object in not allowing
them to pass.</p>

<p>The locality was a deserted one. It was half
way between two summer resorts, and there was
not a house in sight. It was about as lonesome a
place as one could find in the midst of civilization.
Nothing was to be seen but sand and rank grass.</p>

<p>“Do you s’pose these men had anything to do
with stealing our boat and with the lighthouse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
plot?” asked Bob, as he and his chums walked
along.</p>

<p>“I’m not good at riddles,” returned Jerry.
“First we’ll see what the cove holds.”</p>

<p>They kept on for an hour and began to work
their way in toward the shore again. They kept
a careful watch for the men but saw no one. They
came to a place where the weeds and grass were
quite high. It was tangled together by the wind
and they had to struggle to get through it. Jerry,
who was in the lead, emerged on a clear, sandy
place. He gave one look down and uttered a low
cry.</p>

<p>“What is it?” called Ned.</p>

<p>“The secret of the cove!” exclaimed Jerry.</p>

<p>He pointed to a small body of water below
them as they stood on a high sand bank. As the
boys looked they saw a sailing vessel and another
craft floating near a small dock.</p>

<p>“There’s the sloop!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“And there’s our boat!” exclaimed Ned.
“We have found her again!”</p>

<p>“Easy!” whispered Jerry as he sank down,
pulling his companions to the earth. “There are
the men!”</p>

<p>As he spoke three roughly dressed men came
from a small shack near the dock, and walked to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
where the sloop was moored. They were
carrying boxes and bales aboard.</p>

<p>“Looks like the stuff we picked up from the
broken-backed steamer,” whispered Ned.</p>

<p>“I guess they’re wreckers, who gather stuff
that floats ashore,” came from Jerry.</p>

<p>“And I’ll bet they’re the men I heard plotting
about the lighthouse,” said Ned. “We are on
their track!”</p>

<p>“But how did they get their boat in here, and
how did they float the <i>Dartaway</i> in?” asked
Jerry. “This looks like a little lake.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that a sort of creek over there?” asked
Bob, pointing to an opening in the midst of the
rushes that surrounded the cove.</p>

<p>“So it is. That’s what he meant about high
tide. They can only get in the cove when the
tide is up, and makes an entrance by way of the
creek.”</p>

<p>“And, for the same reason, we can’t get our
boat out until high tide, and that will not be until
late to-night,” said Bob. “We’ll have to wait
until then.”</p>

<p>“Lucky we have the chance,” came from Ned.
“I hope the coast will be clear.”</p>

<p>“We’ll get our boat, anyhow!” exclaimed
Jerry. “I’d like to see those men keep her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ll wait until there’s water enough in the
creek to float her out, and then we’ll sneak down
there, get in and start off before they know what’s
happened,” spoke Ned. “I hope she’s in running
order.”</p>

<small>AT THE LIGHTHOUSE</small></h2>


<p>The boys remained concealed in the high grass
for some time. They watched the men moving
about on the sloop and near the hut, but the
thieves seemed to pay little attention to the motor
boat.</p>

<p>“I wonder if they’re getting ready for a trip?”
said Bob. “That will make it easier. If they
leave we can go down there and get something to
eat.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Chunky!” exclaimed Ned. “You&mdash;”
but he could think of nothing appropriate to say,
and so stopped short.</p>

<p>“They’re all boarding the sloop,” Jerry remarked,
as he saw four men come from the shack
and go on the sailing vessel. “Going out of the
cove maybe.”</p>

<p>“Can’t, with the water as low as it is.”</p>

<p>“I only hope they go to sleep in the shack,”
Ned remarked. “It will be easier for us then.”</p>

<p>Through the long afternoon the boys waited.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
The little camp on the shore of the hidden cove
seemed deserted. None of the men was to be
seen. Toward evening there arose a thin column
of smoke from the galley of the sloop.</p>

<p>“They’re getting supper,” remarked Bob, with
a sorrowful note in his voice.</p>

<p>“Never mind, Chunky, you’ll get yours sooner
or later,” said Jerry as comfortingly as he could.</p>

<p>As it grew darker the boys noticed that the
water in the cove was agitated. The sloop, and
the motor boat rocked at their anchorages.</p>

<p>“The tide’s coming in,” said Jerry. “It will
soon be time to act. I hope we can get to the
<i>Dartaway</i> without being seen.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to,” spoke Ned. “If they see us
it means we’ll have a lot of trouble. We must
crawl along until we get close to her. Then we’ll
get in. I’ll crank up, you can steer, and Bob can
use a boat-hook to fend us out from the shore.”</p>

<p>“Lucky she’s headed the right way to get out
of the cove,” Jerry remarked. “It will save
time by not having to turn her.”</p>

<p>Thus it was arranged, and the boys, tired and
hungry, remained hidden in the grass until it was
dark enough to put their plan in operation.</p>

<p>They watched the sloop closely. After their
supper aboard, the men came on deck and stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
conversing a while. The boys could just make
out their forms in the dusk. One seemed to be
doing the most talking, and he frequently
motioned off toward the sea.</p>

<p>“Acts as if he was trying to get them to go
somewhere,” spoke Bob softly.</p>

<p>But in the end the men went ashore, and after
looking to the fastening of the motor boat and a
small rowing craft tied near it, they went into the
shack. Presently lights shone from it, and Jerry
said:</p>

<p>“I guess we can sneak down now. Go easy,
everybody.”</p>

<p>Cautiously the boys left their hiding places
and began to descend the slope that led from the
bluff to the shore of the cove. Every now and
then they paused to listen. They could hear the
men laughing and talking in the hut.</p>

<p>Foot by foot they crept nearer. There was a
path leading from the top of the sand dune to the
hut, but the boys did not take this, fearing they
would be seen. Instead they crawled on their
hands and knees through the grass. The process
was a painful and slow one, for their arms and
legs came in contact with sand burrs, while innumerable
insects attacked them. But they suffered
in silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>“Easy now, we’re almost there,” came from
Jerry.</p>

<p>At that moment the door of the hut opened,
and a man looked out. The boys, with wildly
beating hearts, crouched down. They feared they
had been discovered.</p>

<p>“See anything?” called some one from inside
the hut.</p>

<p>“No,” was the answer, “I thought I heard some
one at the boats, but I guess it was the tide swinging
the sloop. Looks like a storm. Hope we’ll
get one by to-morrow night. It’ll be just what
we need,” and the man re-entering the hut, closed
the door.</p>

<p>For a few seconds after this the boys remained
silent in the grass.</p>

<p>“Lucky escape, that,” murmured Bob. “Five
seconds more and he’d caught us.”</p>

<p>Cautiously they resumed the progress toward
the boat. Nearer and nearer they came until
Jerry, who was in the lead, was able to step over
the side into it. Ned and Bob followed. The
latter grasped a boat-hook and stood ready to
fend off when the start was made. Ned and
Jerry cut the bow and stern lines with which the
<i>Dartaway</i> was made fast to the little dock. They
worked quickly and silently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>Jerry turned on the gasolene, and waited a few
seconds to allow it to fill the carburettor, as the
boat had not been run in several hours. Then he
switched on the spark.</p>

<p>“Turn her over!” he whispered to Ned, who
was in the engine cockpit.</p>

<p>The big flywheel went around under the impulse
of Ned’s sturdy arm. There was a sort of
cough from the engine. Then came a chug, followed
by a splutter, and the motor got into action.</p>

<p>“Fend her off! She’s headed into the bank,
and I can’t steer her out quick enough!” cried
Jerry to Bob.</p>

<p>Chunky pushed with all his strength, on the
pole, against the bank. Slowly the nose of the
boat came out from the shore. The screw was
churning the water into foam. Jerry spun the
wheel around, and headed the craft for the channel,
the opening of which he could just make
out.</p>

<p>At that instant the door of the hut flew open,
and in the light which streamed forth several men
could be seen running toward the shore.</p>

<p>“Hi there! Stop! Bring that boat back!”
they called.</p>

<p>“Guess not! She’s ours!” Ned called back.</p>

<p>“We’re off!” exclaimed Jerry in a low tone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
“She’s running like a charm. They’ll never
catch us!”</p>

<p>There was the sound of feet on the dock. Then
came a squeaking of a pulley block, the creak of
ropes and the rattle of the boom on the mast.</p>

<p>“What’s the use going after them in the
sloop?” they heard some one cry. “There’s no
wind. Take the rowboat!”</p>

<p>The thud of men jumping into the small craft
tied near the sail boat could be heard. There
was the rattle of oars, and then the splash of them
in the water.</p>

<p>“They’ll never get out of the channel,” the
boys heard one of the men say. “We’ll catch
’em before they strike open water.”</p>

<p>“You will, eh?” thought Jerry. “We’ll see
about that.”</p>

<p>The engine was speeded up. Jerry was beginning
to distinguish things better as his eyes
became accustomed to the darkness on the water.
The channel was a narrow and winding one,
but the incoming tide had made it plenty deep
enough.</p>

<p>The boys could hear the men frantically rowing
after them, but it was a hopeless race. The
<i>Dartaway</i> was speeding ahead. It kept Jerry
busy steering to avoid running into the bank, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
presently the channel widened and he had no more
difficulty. On sped the craft until the little creek
emerged into a small bay, which, in turn, opened
into the ocean.</p>

<p>“We’re safe now!” cried Jerry. “Let’s
light the lamps, and put for home.”</p>

<p>The men in pursuit had been left far behind.
While Jerry held the boat on her course up the
beach Ned and Bob kindled the red and green
side lights and the search lantern. In about two
hours the <i>Dartaway</i> was safe at her dock, and the
boys were telling their story to a number of their
friends.</p>

<p>“We must notify the police and get after those
thieves,” said Captain Jenkinson. “They’re
dangerous men to have around. It’s a good thing
you discovered that cove. They probably have
been hiding there a long time.”</p>

<p>But the primitive police system of the shore
summer resort could not be gotten in readiness for
a raid that night, and when some constables did
go to the cove the next morning they found the
sloop gone and the hut seemingly deserted.</p>

<p>The boys found their boat had suffered little
damage at the hands of the thieves. Some tools
had been removed as had a few of the cooking
utensils, but these were easily replaced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now I guess we’d better make a trip to the
lighthouse,” remarked Ned, the next afternoon,
when the <i>Dartaway</i> had been put in shape. “We
ought to warn Mr. Hardack.”</p>

<p>“And, incidentally, I suppose, Jessica,” added
Bob.</p>

<p>“I think they’ll give the whole plan up, now
they see we are after them,” Jerry added. “I
believe they’ve cleared out for good.”</p>

<p>“It’ll do no harm to go over and see Mr. Hardack,”
Ned insisted. “If we find out there’s no
likelihood of the thing coming off, we needn’t say
anything.”</p>

<p>They got to the lighthouse about five o’clock.
Mr. Hardack greeted them warmly.</p>

<p>“Come right in,” he said. “Sorry Jessica is
not home. She was just wishing some visitors
would come, and about an hour ago that Nixon
chap came along in his boat and took her for a
ride.”</p>

<p>Ned seemed less happy than when the start
had been made.</p>

<p>“But come in,” the lighthouse keeper went on.
“I’ve got some fresh milk and Jessica baked some
cookies this morning.”</p>

<p>Bob was the only one who looked pleased.</p>

<p>As the boys were getting out of their boat they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
saw a man coming down toward where the oil
lamps were usually filled. At first they thought
it was Bill Berry, but a second look showed them
it was not.</p>

<p>“Got a new helper?” asked Jerry, trying to
speak calmly.</p>

<p>“Yes, my other one skipped off yesterday.
This chap came along and I hired him. Had to
have some one in a hurry.”</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a><br />
<small>HELD PRISONERS</small></h2>


<p>The boys glanced at each other. This was
something they had not counted on. Evidently
Bill’s companions had told him what had happened,
the night the motor boat was stolen, and he
had fled, for some reason. It looked as if the
scheme of the plotters had fallen through.</p>

<p>“Did Bill&mdash;er&mdash;did your other helper say
where he was going?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Not a word. He was filling the lamps&mdash;let’s
see&mdash;it was yesterday morning&mdash;come to
think of it. A boat pulled up at my dock, and a
man got out and spoke to Bill. I had to go up
in the tower, then. When I came down Bill was
gone and so was the man in the boat.”</p>

<p>“Rather strange,” commented Jerry.</p>

<p>“So it struck me,” Mr. Hardack went on.
“But then you know these chaps are sort of
tramps. They’re here to-day and gone to-morrow.
Always roving around. Of course in the
winter I have a regular assistant the government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
provides, but in the summer time, just as at the
life saving stations, they take things a bit easier.
However, this other man came along, and he
seems a lot nicer than Bill Cherry or whatever his
name was.”</p>

<p>The keeper led the way up the steps to the
house, the boys following.</p>

<p>“Guess it’s just as well not to say anything,”
spoke Ned in a low voice. “They’ve given up
the plot. We’d only be laughed at if we mentioned
it.”</p>

<p>His companions agreed with him, glad enough
to feel there was going to be no attempt to wreck
a ship by means of false lights. The keeper set
out a big pitcher of cool milk and a plate of cookies,
which, as Bob said, were the best he ever ate,
but then Bob was apt to say that about anything
in the culinary line.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Mr. Hardack was saying, “Jessica
would have been glad to see you. Poor girl, she
has quite a trouble on her mind. I’ve been
hoping things would straighten out, but they
don’t seem to. Her father, he&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ting-a-ling-ling-ling!” rang the telephone
bell. The keeper sprang to answer it. The
boys listened idly to the one-sided conversation.</p>

<p>“Yes, this is Mr. Hardack.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s that? Kate sick?”</p>

<p>“Come over? Yes&mdash;er&mdash;that is&mdash;Yes, I
can come. I forgot I had a new helper. I’ll be
right over. Anything serious?”</p>

<p>“Can’t tell, eh? Well I’ll come as fast as I
can,” and he hung up the receiver.</p>

<p>“Any trouble?” inquired Jerry.</p>

<p>“Looks like it,” the keeper said. “My sister
is quite sick. Taken suddenly. They want me.”</p>

<p>“Where does she live?”</p>

<p>“It’s about six miles back in the country. I
guess I can make it and get back here by nine or
ten o’clock. I wish I knew whether it would be
safe to leave the new man in charge.”</p>

<p>“Don’t the regulations provide for it?” asked
Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, it’s my day and night off, and I
have a right to go. But I sort of hate to leave
the light with him. He knows all about it, however,
and he’s got a government civil service certificate.
He knows just what to do, for he’s been
in lighthouses before. I wish I knew what to
do.”</p>

<p>“Let us stay and help him,” suggested Ned.</p>

<p>“Will you?” asked Mr. Hardack eagerly.</p>

<p>“Sure,” chorused Jerry and Bob.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll do it. I want to see my sister.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Her health is not very good, and the doctor said
she might die in one of her spells. I’d feel safe
to go if I knew you boys would stay here and
help the new man if necessary.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see to things,” exclaimed Jerry. “It
will be jolly fun to be partly in charge of the
lighthouse.”</p>

<p>“Whatever happens, don’t forget two things,”
cautioned Mr. Hardack.</p>

<p>“What are they?”</p>

<p>“The light must be lit at sunset, and it must
be kept burning all night. It must revolve regularly,
even if it has to be done by hand, and
there must be a white flash and two red ones, at
proper intervals. But, you needn’t worry about
that. The machinery is in perfect order. The
man will light the lamp, and start it going. It
only has to be trimmed once in a while. I’ll be
back before ten o’clock. When Jessica comes,
she’ll get supper for you.”</p>

<p>Ned said nothing, but he looked as if that
would be the best part of it all, while Chunky’s
eyes lighted up at the mention of another meal.</p>

<p>Mr. Hardack was soon ready to go. He had
to walk the entire distance, as there was no conveyance
handy, but he said he did not mind that.</p>

<p>“I’ll introduce you to the new man,” he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
calling his helper from where he was still busy
filling the lamps. “His name is John Elkwood.”</p>

<p>The assistant did not seem a very good natured
chap. He only nodded to the boys, when Mr.
Hardack introduced them, and, as he went back
to his work, Jerry heard him muttering to himself.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I’ll get under way,” said the
keeper as he started off.</p>

<p>“I say,” called Elkwood after him.</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t need those boys here. I can get
along without ’em. They’ll be in the way.”</p>

<p>“I want ’em to stay,” was Mr. Hardack’s
answer, at which the boys heard the new man muttering
again.</p>

<p>“Not very friendly,” commented Jerry. “Still
we can get along I guess.”</p>

<p>The boys spent an hour going over the lighthouse,
with which they were now rather familiar.
In the meanwhile Elkwood was busy filling lamps,
there being a number used in the big tower. He
attended to the light in the big glass lantern and
spent some time oiling the machinery.</p>

<p>“I wonder what time Jessica is coming back?”
said Bob, as they sat down in the sitting room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>“Was that one thought for her and two for
the supper?” inquired Jerry.</p>

<p>“It’s about time she should be back, I think,”
came from Ned.</p>

<p>“He’s only thinking of her, you see, Chunky,”
Jerry went on.</p>

<p>“No, but it seems to be getting foggy,” added
Ned, “and Noddy isn’t any too good a hand at
managing a boat. I wish she hadn’t gone out
with him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she’ll be all right,” commented Bob.
“Tell you what’s let’s do. We’ll get supper and
have it all ready when she comes. I guess we
can find the things to eat.”</p>

<p>“Trust Chunky for that even if he doesn’t
have any dishes on the table,” Jerry remarked.
“Well, we’ll get the meal and invite Noddy to
it.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it!” exclaimed Ned. “When
he sees us here he’ll go back where he came from,
fast enough.”</p>

<p>The boys found a well-stocked pantry, and, because
of their camping experiences had little difficulty
in getting a meal ready. By this time it
was nearly seven o’clock. Ned kept rather anxious
watch of the hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let’s go down to the dock and see if we can
get sight of her,” he suggested.</p>

<p>“Who?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Why Jessica. It’s time she was back.”</p>

<p>Though he did not say so, Jerry was also a little
anxious. The weather looked anything but
promising, and he had small respect for Noddy’s
ability to manage a motor boat in a calm, let alone
a storm. Still there seemed to be no cause for
alarm.</p>

<p>The craft might have been stalled, but he did
not believe Noddy would venture far from shore,
and, in the event of a breakdown, he could signal
to other boats, as there were several about the
harbor.</p>

<p>It was still quite light, and would not be dark
for another hour. It was no use worrying, Jerry
thought, until there was something to get excited
over.</p>

<p>They all went down to the dock, however, and
scanned the sea for a sight of the boat containing
the girl and Noddy. Though there were several
craft in sight the boys did not notice Noddy’s,
which they had come to know from seeing it
several times. It was one with a blue hull, distinguishable
for some distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>“I vote we eat,” said Bob, as he turned to go
back to the house.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be polite,” suggested Ned.
“We’re only visitors.”</p>

<p>As they walked up the stone steps leading to
the house, the boys were met by Elkwood. The
man had a scowl on his face.</p>

<p>“It’s time you chaps were moving,” he said in
surly tones. “I don’t want you hanging around
here.”</p>

<p>“Why, Mr. Hardack asked us to stay,” put in
Jerry.</p>

<p>“I don’t care whether he did or not. I’m in
charge here. This is government property and
I’m the boss. I tell you to go, and don’t lose any
time over it, either.”</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll stay,” said Jerry coolly. “We
told Mr. Hardack we would, and we’re going
to.”</p>

<p>“And I say you’re not. I order you off. It’s
against the regulations for you to be here after
dark.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t dark yet,” spoke Ned.</p>

<p>“None of your lip!” exclaimed Elkwood.
“Are you going to leave?”</p>

<p>“Not until Mr. Hardack comes back!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then you can take the consequences!”</p>

<p>Elkwood put his fingers to his lips and blew a
shrill whistle. At the signal three men sprang
out from behind some rocks that bordered the
stairway. They rushed at the boys, who were
too surprised to stir. One of the men was Bill
Berry.</p>

<p>“We’ve got you this time!” their old enemy
cried.</p>

<p>The next instant the boys were struggling with
the men, who endeavored to throw bags over their
heads.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</a><br />
<small>TRYING TO ESCAPE</small></h2>


<p>The struggle was a sharp but short one. The
boys were no match for the husky men, and though
the lads kicked and punched with all their might,
they could not save themselves. In a few minutes
they were securely bound, and with the bags
tight over their heads, were picked up by the
men.</p>

<p>“Where you going to put ’em?” they heard
Elkwood ask.</p>

<p>“The storehouse is a good place,” Bill Berry
replied. “They can yell there all night and
never be heard. Take ’em to the storeroom!”</p>

<p>The boys felt themselves being carried up the
steps. Then they could tell, by the muffled
footfalls, that they were being taken into some
dungeon-like place.</p>

<p>“Shall we leave the bags on?” one of the men
asked.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t want to smother ’em,” Bill replied.
“They can’t make themselves heard in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
here, no matter how they yell. Besides, there’s nobody
around. We’ve got Hardack out of the
way and he’ll not be back until morning.”</p>

<p>“You forget the girl. She may be back any
minute.”</p>

<p>“I guess not. Noddy has charge of her.
He’ll detain her some way or other. Those
motor boats have a habit of breaking down, you
know.”</p>

<p>Then the bags were taken from the boys’ heads,
but their bonds were not removed, and they were
laid down on the cold stone floor of the storeroom.
With sinking hearts they heard the men
withdraw and lock the door, leaving them prisoners
in total darkness.</p>

<p>For a few seconds none of the boys spoke.
They were so surprised and shocked at the suddenness
of it all they did not know what to say.
At length Jerry’s voice broke the silence:</p>

<p>“Are either of you hurt?”</p>

<p>“Only scratched and bruised,” replied Ned.</p>

<p>“My wrists are cut by the rope, and my legs
hurt,” said Bob. “I’m hun&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Let up on that!” exclaimed Jerry with a violence
he seldom used. “This is no time to think
of eating. Boys, it’s a mighty serious matter.
These men are going to wreck the ship!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you think so?” inquired Bob.</p>

<p>“Of course; what else is it? They have carried
their plot into effect, but they did it differently
than I expected. Bill Berry’s going away
was only a blind, and it fooled us. This new
man, of course, is in the game. He came along
as soon as Bill left, so no one else would be hired
for the place.”</p>

<p>“Do you think they got Mr. Hardack away by
a false message?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Of course they did. It was all in the game.
Noddy is helping them.”</p>

<p>“If I ever get hold of him I’ll make him wish
he’d never had a hand in it,” and Ned spoke so
sincerely that his companions knew he would keep
his word. They thought of Jessica out alone
with the bully, who, possibly had purposely disabled
the engine to keep her from getting back to
the lighthouse.</p>

<p>“Oh, if we could only do something,” exclaimed
Ned.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to!” cried Jerry. “We can’t let
the ship be wrecked by them changing the light.”</p>

<p>“But how we going to stop ’em?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“We must try and get loose,” Jerry replied.
“They tied us in such a hurry maybe some of the
knots will slip. That’s our only plan. There’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
no use calling for help. It’s just as Bill said, no
one would hear us. Try and work your hands
free.”</p>

<p>They all tried but to little purpose. The ropes
were firmly tied. Strain as they did they could
not loosen the fastenings, and at last they had to
stop, as the cords cut into their flesh.</p>

<p>“Well, they certainly got us into a trap!” exclaimed
Jerry as, once more, he tugged at his
bonds.</p>

<p>Suddenly Bob uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt?” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“Something cut my wrist!”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“A piece of glass, I think.”</p>

<p>“Glass! Good!” came from Jerry. “Can
you get it in your hands?”</p>

<p>“I have it.”</p>

<p>“Roll over towards me, and bring it with you.”</p>

<p>Bob did so. He came close to where Jerry was
still tugging away at the ropes.</p>

<p>“How did you find it, Bob?”</p>

<p>“I was trying to get the knot loose and something
sharp touched my wrist. I felt around until
I found the glass.”</p>

<p>“What’s your plan, Jerry?” sung out Ned.</p>

<p>“I’m going to get Bob to hold the glass and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
I’m going to saw through the ropes on my hands.
Then I’ll set you all free!”</p>

<p>“Can you do it?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to make a big try.”</p>

<p>Then in the darkness they began their efforts to
escape. Bob stretched out on his face, holding the
jagged piece of glass from a broken bottle between
his bound hands. By careful feeling Jerry edged
his way over to him, until he could bring his wrists
close to Bob’s. Then both boys turned on their
side, back to back, and Jerry began sawing at the
cords that bound him.</p>

<p>It was hard work, and more than once they had
to stop because their arms ached. Several times
Jerry’s hands slipped and the glass cut him, but he
did not mind. Back and forth he drew the rope
over the keen edge until he could feel the strands
giving way.</p>

<p>“It’s almost loose,” he said.</p>

<p>In another minute he gave a triumphant cry.</p>

<p>“I’m free!”</p>

<p>“Now to loosen us!” called Ned.</p>

<p>Jerry reached into his pocket for his knife.
Luckily the men had not searched them, or taken
anything away from the boys. With his hands
free Jerry soon had the ropes from his legs. Then
he cut the bonds of Ned and Bob. Their limbs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
were stiff, from being tied so long, but vigorous
rubbing soon restored the circulation.</p>

<p>“Now to escape!” exclaimed Jerry. “We
must find a way out of this, and stop the rascals
from setting the false lights!”</p>

<p>They stumbled about in the darkness. The
storehouse was filled with boxes and barrels, over
which they fell as they felt around, seeking for
some door or window. At last Ned cried out:</p>

<p>“Here’s a door!”</p>

<p>The other boys made their way toward the
sound of his voice.</p>

<p>“It’s locked!” said Jerry, as he pushed against
the portal.</p>

<p>“Can’t we batter it down with a box or a barrel!”
Bob said.</p>

<p>They searched around in the gloom for something
to use, but could find nothing. Everything
was too heavy.</p>

<p>“Maybe we can cut around the lock with our
knives,” suggested Ned.</p>

<p>In the darkness and silence they toiled. They
could hear nothing from the men they knew must
be in the lighthouse, working to cause the destruction
of the steamer. They felt as if they were imprisoned
in a vault.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wonder if we can get out and be in time?”
said Ned. “It must be quite late.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk! Work!” came from Jerry.</p>

<p>They redoubled their efforts to cut around the
lock. But the door to the storeroom was thick
and strong, and the lock was a heavy one.</p>

<p>“It’s no use,” declared Bob after an hour’s
hacking away at the tough wood. “We’ll have to
stay here until they let us out.”</p>

<p>“Don’t give up,” Ned spoke.</p>

<p>“Hark! What’s that?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>The others listened.</p>

<p>“They’ve started the machinery!” cried Bob.
“The lenses are turning.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and they are the wrong ones! They will
get the ship on the rocks!” cried Jerry. “We
must escape!”</p>

<p>Terror struck to the boys’ hearts. They had
tried every means and failed. The plotters had
outwitted them. They could do nothing. They
beat upon the door with their fists as though by
their feeble efforts they could break it down.</p>

<p>Ned stumbled aimlessly in the darkness, seeking
for something with which to batter down the
door. As he passed by a pile of boxes and barrels
he uttered a cry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>“Have you found anything?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Something, yes! A window in the wall! An
open window!”</p>

<p>Bob and Jerry hurried to where they heard
Ned’s voice. As they did so he had climbed up
on a box. He pressed his face close against the
wall. A cool wind fanned his cheek.</p>

<p>“There is an opening!” he exclaimed. “But
it is too small for us to get out of. It’s only a
ventilating window. But wait! Someone is coming!”</p>

<p>The boys almost held their breaths. Then Ned
called in a loud whisper:</p>

<p>“Jess! Jess! Here we are! Let us out!
Some bad men are in charge of the place and are
going to change the lights! They are going to
wreck a steamer!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</a><br />
<small>JESS TO THE RESCUE</small></h2>


<p>“Who are you talking to?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Jess, of course,” replied Ned, greatly excited.
“She’s outside. Jess! Jess!” he called again.
“We are locked in the storeroom!”</p>

<p>The boys waited anxiously. Then, from without,
came a whisper that sounded loudly through
the darkened room.</p>

<p>“What has happened? Where is my uncle?
Who are you?”</p>

<p>“It’s me; Ned,” was the reply, whispered from
the prison. “They captured us! Have you a
key? Can you let us out? How did you get
away from Noddy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, this is terrible!” cried Jess. “How did
it happen?”</p>

<p>She was standing under the small slit in the
masonry that served to let air into the storeroom.
The light from a lamp in the kitchen of the place
streamed out from a window full on her, so Ned
could see the girl plainly, though of course she
could not see him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why you are all wet!” cried Ned. “Did
you fall in the water?”</p>

<p>“No, I jumped,” came the tense whisper.
“What shall I do to let you out?”</p>

<p>“Can you get the key to this place?” asked
Ned. “If you can, sneak into the house, and
open the door, let us out and we’ll call help, and
try to prevent the men from changing the light.”</p>

<p>“Where is my uncle?”</p>

<p>“He was called away, by a false telephone message,
we believe, to see his sick sister! The men
put up a game to get him away! Quick Jess, or
it will be too late!”</p>

<p>Ned saw the girl step back out of the path of
illumination and gaze upward. As she did so
she uttered a half suppressed scream.</p>

<p>“They are changing the light!” she uttered in
a shrill whisper. “And there’s a storm about to
break! What shall I do?”</p>

<p>As she spoke there came a low rumble of thunder
off to the west and a flash of lightning.</p>

<p>“Let us out if possible!” whispered Ned.
“They are so busy with the light they may not
notice you. Get the keys and let us out!”</p>

<p>“I will! I will!” exclaimed Jess. “If I can
only succeed!”</p>

<p>Ned saw her dart around the corner of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
house. Then she was out of his line of vision.
They could only wait developments now.</p>

<p>“Do you think she can do it?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“She will if it’s possible,” replied Ned. “Only
there is not much time. My! But it’s going to
storm fierce!”</p>

<p>A loud crash of thunder sounded, making the
stout lighthouse vibrate. The flashes of lightning
showed through the ventilating window, illuminating
the small apartment with a weird glow. The
wind was howling about the place.</p>

<p>“There’ll be a heavy sea on,” said Jerry.
“The ship will get upon the rocks and go to pieces.
Then these scoundrels will go out and pick up the
cargo.”</p>

<p>“There may be many lives lost,” exclaimed Bob.
“The life saving station is short-handed. They
all are in the summer time.”</p>

<p>“If Jess can only get the keys!” Ned murmured.</p>

<p>It seemed like an hour before there sounded a
tapping on the storeroom door. Ned sprang to
answer it.</p>

<p>“Are you still there, boys?” they heard Jess
ask.</p>

<p>“Yes! Yes!” whispered Jerry. “Have you
the keys?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, the men must have taken them.”</p>

<p>“Then get an axe and see if you can’t break
the lock.”</p>

<p>“It is too strong. Besides they might hear the
blows.”</p>

<p>“Where are the men?”</p>

<p>“In the lantern tower,” the girl replied.
“Wait a minute, let me think of a plan.”</p>

<p>Outside the storm was raging. Locked in the
storeroom the boys felt like beating at the door
with their fists to break it down, so they might get
out, change the light, and save the steamer.</p>

<p>“I have it!” Jess whispered through the big
keyhole. “I will burn the lock out.”</p>

<p>“How?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“With a hot poker. I’ll heat it in the kitchen
stove. I’ll burn a lot of little holes all around the
lock, and then I can knock the piece of door out!
The men can’t hear that!”</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Ned. “Hurry Jess!”</p>

<p>They could hear the girl moving about the
kitchen. The rattle of iron on iron came to their
ears. Presently there was the smell of burning
wood. It grew stronger. Then a dull red point
pierced the door, and came through into the storeroom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s the first hole!” whispered Jess. “I’ll
burn them as fast as I can.”</p>

<p>To the boys it seemed as if there was half an
hour between each reappearance of the glowing
point of the poker, but it was only a few minutes.
There were seven holes burned, when they heard
Jess hurry away.</p>

<p>Then resounded the tramp of feet in the lower
part of the lighthouse. A few seconds later the
boys heard voices.</p>

<p>“Is it working all right?” a man asked.</p>

<p>“You bet,” was the reply. “Now you and
Bill had better put off in the sloop. She’ll strike
pretty soon, and you may pick up passengers with
a lot of valuables.”</p>

<p>“It’s blowing pretty hard to go out in the
sloop,” one of the crowd objected.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t get chicken-hearted,” was the sneering
response. “You and Bill have got to go.
Me and Jim will stay here and work the light.
We can tell when the rockets go up that she’s
struck, and then we’ll skip. We’ll meet at the
cove.”</p>

<p>The voices died away, as though the men had
left. The sound of the storm increased.
Anxiously the boys waited for Jess to come back.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
It was several minutes before she did so. Then
she whispered through the keyhole:</p>

<p>“I had to run and hide when I heard the men
coming from the tower. Two of them have gone
out, and the others have gone back to the light.
We must hurry!”</p>

<p>Once more came the smell of burning wood,
and once more the dull red point of the poker began
to show. But it was slow work, for the door
was thick, and of hard material. Then too, the
poker would get cool carrying it from the stove to
the portal.</p>

<p>But Jess worked like an Amazon. Back and
forth she went with the hot iron, burning herself
several times when it slipped. But she gave small
heed to this. She wanted to save the ship and the
honor of her uncle, who might be blamed for losing
control of the lighthouse.</p>

<p>Hole after hole was burned. Now Ned began
trying to knock out the piece of door containing
the lock. He found a small stone and hammered
on the weakened wood. But it was still too strong
for the feeble instrument he had.</p>

<p>“Ten more holes and I think it will come out,”
the girl whispered.</p>

<p>Out on the deep, struggling through the storm
which had suddenly broken, was a large steamer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
laden with a rich cargo. There were not many
passengers, as it was from a South American port,
but these few, as well as the crew, had no warning
of the danger that threatened them.</p>

<p>In the bow stood the lookout, scanning the expanse
of angry water for a sight of lighthouses
and headlands that would indicate the channel up
the dangerous coast. Suddenly off to his left
there shot out two brilliant red flashes.</p>

<p>“North light two points off the port bow!” he
called to the pilot.</p>

<p>“Lookout?” called the pilot.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure that’s the North light?”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir. The south light shows a white
flash and two red ones. These were only two
red. There they are again, sir.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I see them,” as once more the false lights
flashed across the sea. “We must have passed
the South light while the weather was thicker.
I’ll have to put her in a bit.”</p>

<p>Then the pilot, deceived by the light, steered the
vessel over toward the ledge of dangerous rocks,
instead of keeping out, as he would have done,
had the two red flashes been preceded by a white
one.</p>

<p>But in the lighthouse three brave boys and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
brave a girl, were striving to aid the ill-fated
steamer. Would they be in time?</p>

<p>Jess made hole after hole, though her arms
ached, her eyes smarted with the smoke, and her
hands were burned in a number of places.</p>

<p>Again and again Ned beat with his stone on the
wood around the lock. The circle of holes was
complete at last.</p>

<p>“It’s giving away! It’s loosening!” cried the
boy. He struck with all his force. The stone
flew from his hand, and fell through the opening
that suddenly appeared. The lock had been
burned away, and the heavy door swung inward.
The boys were free.</p>

<p>“Now to change the lights!” cried Jerry, as,
followed by his chums he dashed toward the winding
stairs that led to where the big lantern lenses
revolved.</p>

<p>At that instant the door of the kitchen flew open
and Mr. Hardack entered, wild and disheveled,
dripping water from the storm which was now
raging at its height.</p>

<small>THE RIGHT LIGHTS</small></h2>


<p>“What has happened!” cried the keeper.
“The light is flashing wrong! There is a steamer
outside the bar! It will be wrecked! Who did it?
Where is my assistant? There’s been foul work
here! I was waylaid on my way back when I
found my sister was not ill. I just managed to
get away from the men. Speak, some of you!
Quick!”</p>

<p>The keeper was panting from his exertions and
from the excitement. His face was drawn and
pale, and his eyes were wild, while his hair, matted
by the rain, for he had lost his hat, straggled about
his forehead.</p>

<p>“The scoundrels are in possession of the
tower!” cried Jerry. “We must attack them
and set the right light!”</p>

<p>“Come on!” cried the keeper, seizing the poker
Jess had used to burn the door. “Come on! I’ll
give ’em battle!”</p>

<p>His eyes glared, in the fierceness of his righteous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
anger, at those who would do so dastardly a deed.</p>

<p>“Come on!” cried Ned, seizing a heavy billet
of wood.</p>

<p>“I’ll call the police on the telephone!” exclaimed
Bob, springing for the instrument.
“We’ll need help!”</p>

<p>“I’ll not wait for the police!” fairly shouted
the keeper. “I’ll tackle ’em single handed if
need be!”</p>

<p>Bob rang up central, and, not waiting to be
connected with the distant police station, told the
operator what the trouble was, imploring that aid
be sent promptly. Then he ran to join his companions.
Jess was crying in one corner of the
room.</p>

<p>Mr. Hardack led the way to the stairs which
extended up inside the tower to the lantern. He
fairly ran up the stone steps, followed by the boys.
He was shouting challenges to the men as he ran.</p>

<p>“Let me get at you!” he yelled. “I’ll show
you how an old man can fight!”</p>

<p>Suddenly from above them a door slammed
shut. There was the clicking of a lock. Then, as
they came to the heavy portal, which gave access to
the room where the lantern was, a voice cried:</p>

<p>“You’re too late this time, old man!”</p>

<p>Too late! The men had shut themselves up in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
the top of the tower, and could control the working
of the light to suit their evil purposes. The
keeper could not get in.</p>

<p>Mr. Hardack beat upon the door with the poker.
Ned hammered it with the block of wood.</p>

<p>“Let me in!” cried the aged man. “Let me
in! Do you want to send the ship to the
bottom?”</p>

<p>“That’s just what we do!” was the mocking
response.</p>

<p>“Get an axe and chop the door down!” cried
Jerry.</p>

<p>“It would take too long,” replied the keeper,
in a strangely calm voice. “It is bound with iron,
and is double thick. There is no help for it. The
steamer will be lost!”</p>

<p>Footsteps were heard coming up the stairs.</p>

<p>“Maybe help is at hand,” said the keeper hopefully.</p>

<p>Then Jess came into view. In her hand she
held something which she extended to Mr.
Hardack.</p>

<p>“Here is your old horse pistol, uncle!” she exclaimed.
“It is loaded with a heavy charge.
Fire it through the lock and shatter it! I heard
you pounding on the door and knew they had
locked it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hurrah for you, Jess!” called Ned, and the
girl blushed through her tears.</p>

<p>Mr. Hardack placed the muzzle of the ancient
weapon against the big keyhole. He hesitated a
moment, listening to the roar of the storm without,
and the steady whirr of the machinery in the
tower, as it revolved the false lenses.</p>

<p><em>Bang!</em></p>

<p>It sounded as though a cannon had been fired,
so loudly did the report of the pistol echo in the
narrow tower. There was a splitting and rending
of wood, a snap as of broken springs and a clatter
as pieces of the lock fell on the stone steps.</p>

<p>“Come on, boys!” cried the old man, as he
threw all his weight against the door. The shattered
lock gave, and they rushed through the
smoke on up the steps.</p>

<p>“Go back! Go back!” cried two men standing
on the top landing. Behind them glowed the
big light. It almost blinded the boys. They
hesitated a second or two.</p>

<p>“Scoundrels!” cried the keeper.</p>

<p>He raised the poker threateningly and leaped
forward.</p>

<p>“Come on! All together!” yelled Ned.
“We can handle ’em! Come on, Jerry and
Bob!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>Forward they went, the boys and the aged
keeper, straight at the two men. The fellows held
big wrenches in their hands. Jerry saw one aim a
blow at Mr. Hardack. It struck the old man on
the side of the head, but, though he staggered,
he did not fall. Then he raised his poker and
brought it down on the arm of the man who had
hit him. The wrecker gave a cry and the wrench
fell from his nerveless fingers.</p>

<p>Ned sprang at the assailant of the keeper. The
fellow stepped back. He had lost the use of one
arm from the blow of the poker. Ned grabbed
his other hand and bore him to the stone floor.
There was a hard struggle, but Ned held on.
Mr. Hardack, recovering from the blow on his
head, came to the boy’s aid.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Jerry and Bob had attacked
the other man. He kept them at bay for a little
while by waving the big wrench back and forth in
front of him. The boys tried to dodge in but
could not. Then Jerry suddenly fell to the floor.
Before the man knew what was up the boy had
reached forward, under the swinging tool, and
grabbed the man by the legs. He gave a strong
yank, and the wrecker went down in a heap. Bob
threw himself on top of him.</p>

<p>For several seconds there was a hard struggle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Both scoundrels tried to break away, but the boys
and the keeper were too much for them. At last
they were quiet.</p>

<p>“The light! The light!” cried Mr. Hardack.
“We must set the right light!”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it, uncle!” exclaimed Jess, running into
the room. She had been hiding on the stairs, waiting
the outcome of the struggle. “I’ll set the
right light!”</p>

<p>She leaped over the prostrate body of the man
her uncle and Ned were holding down. Into the
lantern room she went.</p>

<p>It was the work of but an instant to rip from
the big white lens, the black piece of paper the
men had pasted over it to conceal the flashes. She
threw it on the floor.</p>

<p>Then out through the storm, over the tempestuous
sea, there flashed the right signal,&mdash;a
white glow, followed by two red ones.</p>

<p>“Oh, that it may be in time to save the ship!”
the girl prayed.</p>

<p>Out on the deep the big steamer pitched and
tossed in the grip of the waves. The lookout
was scanning the blackness for the sight of the next
lighthouse. Suddenly there flashed across his eyes
a white shaft of illumination, followed by two red
ones. The pilot saw them at the same time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>“Something’s wrong!” the steersman exclaimed.
“There is the South light now! We
have been standing in! We are almost on the
rocks! Some one changed the lights!”</p>

<p>There were frantic signals to the engine room.
The pilot spun the steam steering gear around so
fast he almost broke the rudder chains. Slowly
the great steamer changed her course and stood
out to sea.</p>

<p>Yet so near had she been to the rocks and sand
bars that five minutes more and she would have
been lost. The passengers asleep in their staterooms
never knew how close they were to death.</p>

<p>Back in the lighthouse there were anxious hearts,
hearts that beat high lest soon might be heard the
booming guns of a ship in distress, or soon might
be seen the flaring rockets that told a steamer had
gone on the rocks.</p>

<p>Suddenly from below, at the foot of the tower,
above the roar of the storm, a voice called:</p>

<p>“What’s wrong here? Where are you,
Hardack? What’s the matter with the light?”</p>

<p>“It’s Salt Water Sam!” shouted Jerry.
“Help Sam! Come up and bring ropes with
you!”</p>

<p>There was the welcome sound of feet ascending
the stone stairway. Into the room came the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
sailor and Captain Jenkinson. They took in the
situation at a glance. In a few minutes the two
scoundrels had been securely tied.</p>

<p>“Is the light all right?” was Sam’s first question,
for he knew what that meant on such a night.</p>

<p>“Thanks to Jess, it is,” replied Ned, and the
girl ran away to escape the admiring eyes.</p>

<p>“How did you get here?” asked Jerry of Sam.</p>

<p>“Why some of us happened to be out fishing
just before the storm broke, and we noticed the
light wasn’t flashing right. I hurried ashore and
met Captain Jenkinson. He had noticed the same
thing, so we decided to investigate. We came
over in his boat, the <i>Three Bells</i>. What has happened
here?”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX</a><br />
<small>JESSICA’S FATHER&mdash;CONCLUSION</small></h2>


<p>“The scoundrels tried to change the light and
wreck a steamer coming up the coast,” replied Mr.
Hardack. “If it hadn’t been for the boys here
they would have succeeded.”</p>

<p>“If it hadn’t been for Jess we could have done
nothing,” put in Jerry. “They had us locked
up.”</p>

<p>“Let’s have the whole yarn,” suggested Sam.</p>

<p>Ned related what he had heard of the plot that
night he had hidden in the <i>Dartaway</i>, and told
how he and the boys on reaching the lighthouse
had been left in charge with the new assistant while
Mr. Hardack went to see his sick sister.</p>

<p>“And that message was all a fake,” said the
keeper. “My sister wasn’t sick at all. I couldn’t
find out who sent it, but I thought something was
wrong, and I hurried back. On the way I was
stopped by two men who wanted to pick a quarrel
with me. They tried to take me off to a lonely
hut, but I broke away and came on through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
storm. You can imagine my feelings when I got
here and saw the light flashing wrong.”</p>

<p>Then the boys told the rest of the tale, including
the successful efforts of Jess to burn the lock from
the door.</p>

<p>“But we haven’t heard how she happened to
arrive at just the right time,” said Bob. “Call
her.”</p>

<p>The girl came into the kitchen where they all
were, the two prisoners having been placed in the
storeroom.</p>

<p>“What happened to you, Jess?” asked her
uncle.</p>

<p>“I jumped overboard and swam ashore,” said
the girl.</p>

<p>“You jumped overboard?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that Nixon fellow took me for a ride in
his boat. Then the engine got out of order, or
he pretended it did, and we couldn’t get back. I
wanted him to signal to some other boat but he
wouldn’t. Then I got mad. He kept me out
there quite a way from shore, saying all the while
the engine would soon be fixed. But when I saw
him taking some screws out I knew he wasn’t trying
to fix the machinery, but was playing a trick to
detain me. Then I jumped into the water and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
swam. I didn’t have much trouble. I’m a good
swimmer, and it wasn’t so very far.”</p>

<p>“You’re a brave girl!” exclaimed Sam warmly,
and Jess tried to run away again, but they would
not let her.</p>

<p>The police whom Bob had telephoned for soon
arrived, and took charge of the two men. They
were eventually sent to prison for long terms.</p>

<p>Search was made for the others of the gang, but
they, including Bill Berry, had escaped in the sloop.
As for Noddy Nixon, he left the summer resort
that night, disappearing soon after he brought in
his boat from which Jess had escaped. At the hut
near the cove, later, among Bill’s belongings, was
found the diamond ring and the case of specimen
mosquitoes stolen from Uriah Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“Well, this will delight the professor!” cried
Jerry, when he heard of the find. “I’ll wager
he’ll think more of the mosquitoes than of the diamond
ring.” It may be added that the professor
was delighted over the recovery of his property
and when he heard of what the boys had accomplished
he praised them highly.</p>

<p>It was learned afterward that Noddy had no
idea of the serious plot the men had planned. Bill
Berry had enlisted the youth’s aid in getting Jess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
out of the way, on the pretense that only a harmless
trick was to be played on the keeper. Noddy’s
previous acquaintance with the girl made this easy.
But Noddy, after Jess left him so suddenly,
thought it best to make himself scarce. Bill, it
seems, had written to him early in the season to
come to the summer resort near the lighthouse.</p>

<p>It was the next afternoon when the boys were
again on a visit to the lighthouse that they learned
how near the steamer had been to the dangerous
rocks. Some men of the life saving station had
seen her approach, and then veer out again suddenly
as the light was changed.</p>

<p>“I declare I don’t know how to thank you
boys,” said Mr. Hardack. “You certainly are
wonders.”</p>

<p>“Jess had us all beaten,” spoke Ned, wondering
where she was.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, poor Jessica. I wish I could help
her out of her trouble as she and you helped me.”</p>

<p>“What trouble?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I ever tell you? I started to several
times, but it must have slipped my mind. Her
father has been missing for several months, and
I’ve not been able to locate him. He’s my only
brother, quite an old man, with white hair, whiter
than mine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys looked at each other. They all had
the same thought,&mdash;of the man in the railroad
wreck.</p>

<p>“He was a miner out west,” Mr. Hardack went
on. “He went there several years ago and left
his daughter with me, because it was a wild country
he was in. I got word a few months ago that he
had started east, having made quite some money.
He was to come here but he never arrived. We’ve
been waiting for him since, and Jess is quite worried.
I wrote to the persons who used to know
him, but they said he had left the mining camp,
and they did not know where he was. I wish I
could locate him.”</p>

<p>Ned felt a lump coming up in his throat. The
other lads seemed strangely affected. It was Jerry
who spoke first.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hardack,” he said. “I don’t want to
raise any false hopes, but I think we can put you
on the track of Jessica’s father.”</p>

<p>“Where is he? Tell me! Oh, I must go to
him if he is in trouble!”</p>

<p>“If he is the man I think him to be, he is in
the hospital at Cresville. We saved a man from
a railroad wreck, who, in his delirium, murmured
something about ‘Jess’ and the ‘great light.’ I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
think he must have meant your niece, and the
‘great light’ referred to the lighthouse.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I only hope so!” exclaimed Mr. Hardack.
“The loss of her father has almost broken
Jessica’s heart. She is in mourning for her dead
mother. How can we find out if the man of the
wreck is my brother?”</p>

<p>“I can telephone to Dr. Bounce,” replied Jerry.
“The man may have recovered by now.”</p>

<p>It took some time to get the long-distance connection
on the telephone from the lighthouse to Dr.
Bounce. While it was being made Jess came into
the room.</p>

<p>“Jess&mdash;dear&mdash;Jessica,” stammered her uncle.
“Would you mind getting dinner?” She left the
room, a little surprised at the serious looks on the
faces of the boys and her uncle. “I didn’t want
her to hear until we know if it’s true,” said the
uncle in a whisper.</p>

<p>At last Jerry was able to converse with Dr.
Bounce. The boy’s voice trembled as he inquired
about the man of the wreck. The others could
only hear one side of the conversation, but they
guessed the rest.</p>

<p>“You say he’s getting better, doctor? That’s
good. Has he been able to give his name? He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
has? What is it? Tell me quick! A lot depends
on it! Pack? Oh! Hardack! Are you
sure? Walter Hardack!”</p>

<p>“It’s him! It’s him! That’s my brother’s
name!” exclaimed the keeper, jumping up and
down in his excitement. “Oh! Jess! Your
father’s found! The boys did it! Oh! Jess!
Praise the good Lord!”</p>

<p>Jess came running into the room, wondering
what was up. She looked at her uncle. There
were tears in the old man’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Your father’s found! Your father’s
found!” was all he could say, as he hugged the
now weeping girl to him.</p>

<p>“Come on,” said Ned softly. “We can return
later.” And the chums withdrew.</p>

<p>Mr. Hardack soon called them back, and made
them tell every detail of the wreck. They surmised
that Jessica’s father had been on his way to
the lighthouse when he was injured. His appeal
to the boys to find his daughter had been no more
than the raving of delirium, caused by the injury to
his head, but it had worked itself out in an unexpected
way.</p>

<p>The next day, with Ned as her guide, Jess
started for Cresville, and a few hours later was
clasped in her father’s arms. He had come successfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
through a serious operation and was now
on the road to recovery.</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked Jerry to Bob, when Ned had
gone away, “we certainly had plenty of excitement
the last few days. Ned is right in it to the
last. Guess Jessica likes him. Well, she’s a
mighty nice girl.”</p>

<p>“Right you are,” replied Bob. “Say, it wasn’t
any mistake to come here for a vacation. I hope
we will have as much fun next year.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” Jerry added. “I wonder if Ned
will come back for the rest of the season?”</p>

<p>“Bet he’ll stay in Cresville now that Jess is
there.”</p>

<p>“Well the summer is almost over,” said Bob a
little sorrowfully. “Of course we can’t expect to
foil a gang of wreckers again, but I hope there’ll
be something just as lively.”</p>

<p>There was, and the boys had what they considered
even better fun than centred around the
lighthouse. Their further doings will be told of
in the next volume, to be called, “The Motor
Boys in Strange Waters; or, Lost in a Floating
Forest.”</p>

<p>“Come on,” said Bob, after a pause. “Let’s
go out in the boat for a spin. It’s a fine day.”</p>

<p>“A little lonesome without Ned, though.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, we’ll see him again, soon.”</p>

<p>They went down to the dock, where they found
Salt Water Sam gazing contemplatively into the
water. He was softly singing to himself:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The Mary Jane, she was a ship<br /></span>
<span class="i3">As fine as one could wish.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I used to sail the seas in her,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And sometimes I would fish.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">One day when I was sailing<br /></span>
<span class="i3">I chanced to catch a shark.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I put him on exhibit<br /></span>
<span class="i3">In a little seaside park!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“Well, well, boys, I didn’t hear you coming,”
the sailor went on. “I was just thinking of the
fun we had.”</p>

<p>“Come on for a sail,” invited Jerry.</p>

<p>Then the two boys and the old man got into the
<i>Dartaway</i> and put off toward the mouth of the
harbor. And here, for a while, we will take leave
of them.</p>
